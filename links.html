                    <p>Collection of my photographs. I mainly use film and develop/scan the entire process myself. More info into these projects can be found under the Portfolio page. Flickr is dying so I may move over to Instagram at some point but I wanna put that off for as long as possible, brothers </p>

                    <h2 style="color:white;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7AJUpk39QCNkiR_BwXSXg">Beavertrail Bois Youtube</a></h2>
                    <p>This is the youtube channel that my best friends and I use to post shitty memes and other content related to our friendship. I initially conceived the idea as a cool dumping ground for the video related memes we'd make and it's sorta kicked off from there. It's something we're all very proud of and enjoy contributing to. The channel is named after a very small city park we'd go to hang out after school during our senior year of high school, Beaver Trail Park</p>

                    <h2 style="color: white;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj_degen">DJ Degen Soundcloud</a></h2>
                    <p>Similar to the above youtube channel, this soundcloud was created to host the aural memes we'd make. Honestly not too many interesting things here but this is a link related to me so therefore it must be included</p>
