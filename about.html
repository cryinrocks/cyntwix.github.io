					<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
					<p>I've always wanted to have my own website. Back when I was first really getting involved on the internet, circa 2007, my sister and I created a pseudo-website using one of those shitty website hosting clients. It wasn't angelfire but it was something very simliar. freewebpages.com or something awful like that. It's been so long that the neurons holding that chunk of info have long since split </p>
					<p>We used to be so enthralled with figuring out how to embed flash games or the youtube videos we'd upload with our friends. The website gradually morphed into a site that just held embedded youtube vids while an awful midi of Bon Jovi's "Livin on a Prayer" played on an endless loop in the background. </p>
					<p>In time, of course, we forgot about the site and eventually the hosting client shutdown for good, our stamp on the internet deleted forever. Although just deleted in that sense. We moved on to focusing more on youtube until the neighborhood group of friends we'd collaborate with gradually split apart and faded as the Clock chunked forward. Nothing we could do about that</p>
					<p>However, the creative energy I had in my youth never fully quit. Would I really consider myself a creative now? I don't know for sure. I'm studying engineering and surrounded by engineering-minded people, so I align myself more with that identity rather than one of an artist. But I've always kept fucking around with making youtube videos, or drawing, or experimenting with new artistic mediums, never with any intention other than just something to occupy my time.</p>
					<p>This website is just another step in this hopefully endless chain of creative endeavors. Combining my age-old desire to have my own personal webpage with the programming knowledge I've gained in school, creating this website just makes sense. It'll be a fun little place to collect My Stuff. I could use tumblr but honestly this is a lot more fun.</p>
					<p>I'm not exactly sure what this website is gonna end up having, or how long I'll even pay attention to it. But I have the domain for a year, so there's that!!</p>
					<p>Also I'm trying to keep this website sorta private and difficult to find, so if somehow you made it here, congrats! Figure out a way to contact me and lemme know, I'd be interested in hearing how you found the URL</p>
					<p>That's all I have for now, stay warm</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>-Adam</p>
