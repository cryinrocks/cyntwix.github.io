					<p>This is the website for $̸̡%̴̡̕̕͠^͟͢͜͝&̸̢͝*̴͟(̸͏̴. It's only for the better if my name does not exist in any TEXT on this site as to not have this domain appear under Google queries for my name. I understand that it is present on the homepage but this website is not for Them it's for Me and You. You either know me personally or found the URL guided by some divine hand. Let's keep it that way.</p>
