					<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
					<p>I've always wanted to have my own website. Back when I was first really getting creatively involved on the internet, circa 2007, my sister and I created a pseudo-website using one of those shitty website hosting clients. It wasn't angelfire but it was something very simliar. freewebpages.com or something awful like that. It's been so long that the neurons holding that chunk of info have long since split </p>
					<p>We used to be so enthralled with figuring out how to embed flash games or the youtube videos we'd upload with our friends. The website gradually morphed into a site that just held embedded youtube vids while an awful midi of Bon Jovi's "Livin on a Prayer" played on an endless loop in the background. </p>
					<p>In time, of course, we forgot about the site and eventually the hosting client shutdown for good, our stamp on the internet deleted forever. Although just deleted in that sense. We moved on to focusing more on youtube until the neighborhood group of friends we'd collaborate with gradually split apart and faded as the Clock chunked forward. Nothing we could do about that</p>
					<p>This website is just another step in this hopefully endless chain of creative endeavors. Combining my age-old desire to have my own personal webpage with some programming, creating this website just makes sense. It'll be a fun little place to collect my Stuff. Take a look around at the various garbage I've accumlated here and maybe you'll see something ya dig, ya dig?</p>
					<p>I'm not exactly sure what this website is gonna end up having, or how long I'll even pay attention to it. But I have the domain for a year, so there's that!!</p>
					<p>That's all I have for now, stay warm</p>
					<p></p>
