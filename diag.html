                    <p>Blunt weapons. Likely the first kind of weapons developed by man, these were often made of bone, wood, or rock. Capable of crushing a skull with a single blow, or bruising the extremities of the adversary, blunted weapons proved to be very deadly and unmatched. Edged weapons. The next progression is found with swords and spears. A slice could turn one part into two, separate head from shoulders. A single thrust could impale, puncturing organs and tissues. Gunpowder. Used by infantry, gunpowder could send small projectiles of lead deep into a man’s skull, completely devastating everything in its path. Used by artillery, gunpowder could send an enormous mass into an enemy congregation, leaving no man standing. Nuclear weapons. The most powerful weapons available today. Capable of wiping out entire cities, even some countries, and leave dangerous residue behind so you do not forget its power. The advancement of weaponry has led to this, and it has gone too far. The bomb is too powerful; we should never have created it.</p>
                    <p>The beginnings of the nuclear bomb lie with two chemists from Germany, Fritz Strassmann and Otto Hahn. They were the first people to split the nuclei of some of the atoms in a sample of Uranium. Using this science, the United States began a project to develop the most dangerous weapon in history. The project was called the Manhattan Project, and was led by J. Robert Oppenheimer. The project strived to develop the first nuclear weapons in human history. They spent countless hours researching and completing calculations to build the bomb; they had no idea what they were creating. The first bomb dropped, codenamed “Trinity,” exceeded the expectations, creating a blast comparable to many kilotons (1 kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 pounds of TNT). This project led to the creations of Fat Man and Little Boy, the two bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II in the Pacific. These two bombs wiped out two cities completely, killing over a hundred thousand people. This was not an act of nature, or by a God, this was caused by mankind.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear weapons can be classified into two types: Atomic bombs, and Hydrogen bombs. While both harness the immense power of atoms, they are very different. Atomic bombs are powered by a process called nuclear fission. This involves rapidly moving neutrons that collide with the nucleus, splitting in two and setting more neutrons free to split other nuclei. When a nucleus is split, energy capable of wiping out city blocks is released. This type of bomb was used for this purpose with the utter destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The other type are Hydrogen Bombs. These bombs utilize nuclear fusion, a process that collides hydrogen particles and fuses them together to create helium. The same process occurs on the sun and requires incredibly high temperatures. On Earth, the only way to reach these temperatures is by detonating an atomic bomb. Hydrogen bombs have been tested, but never used against other humans. The explosive output of a hydrogen bomb is about 1,000 times larger than an atomic bomb. If one were to be launched against another country, the effects would be so devastating that the instigator will never be forgiven. Possibly millions of casualties would be a result, plus years of reconstruction and huge safety measurements would have to be devoted to recreating what was so easily taken away by a creation of man.</p>
                    <p>After a strike, nuclear weapons leave devastating after effects. Cities collapse, leaving heaps of rubble everywhere. The few survivors find their homes gone, destroyed; they need a place to wait for help to arrive, if it arrives before they die from radiation. Many families are torn apart, having their loved ones perish in the radiation. The few survivors must continue to live in the discarded husk of the city they once lived in, maybe grew up in. What they knew before no longer exists thanks to the bomb. The Ground Zero is bombarded with the initial radiation from the blast, x-rays and gamma rays. Afterwards, nuclear fallout radiation, or delayed radiation, remains near the blast zone and continuously harms many victims. The radiation cannot be sensed by a human, which makes it even more dangerous. Large amounts of radiation often kill its victims painfully. However, some do not die initially and suffer from cancer, leukemia, birth defects, or sterility. For those with radiation sickness, no “cure all” drug exists; the process to cure a patient can be very difficult, and often result in failure.</p>
                    <p>The United States has run tests on the radiation given off from a nuclear explosion. In the 1950’s, the United States started to test new bombs, including hydrogen bombs, on islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. One group of islands in particular were the Marshall Islands. In 1954, a hydrogen bomb testing was executed, depositing enormous amounts of radiation and fallout. Three years later, the United States decided it was safe to move the island’s residents back. These people were then exposed to more than three times the radiation given off from the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Exposed to these terrible environments, the islanders felt unsafe and decided to move off of the island. The United States incorrectly told the islanders that it would be safe to move back; they had no idea exactly how badly a nuclear weapon can destroy a society. The weapons are terribly dangerous, and result in no positive outcomes, even from testing.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the bomb’s radiation, the bomb has many other devastating effects. It can create enormous temperatures that burn everything in its path; the explosion can be so bright that it blinds spectators; its shock wave travels outward from the blast zone, remaining equidistant at all times. The wave pummels into everything it touches at close to the speed of sound– 1,100 feet per second. The blast is capable of capable of destroying houses and tall buildings with little effort. Bombarding the structures with upwards of 50 pounds per square inch, the pressure is enough to demolish cement and disintegrate mortar. Many unlucky victims do not die from the blast, but from the collapsing buildings. </p>
                    <p>Too many negative aspects of nuclear weapons overpower the few positive ones– capability of ending wars, establishing military superiority, etc. The bombs are largely vessels for Death, harbingers of destruction and doom. Although only two bombs have been used to wipe out a mass of humans, it does not mean that it will not happen again. In fact, with research being conducted to develop new, stronger bombs, another usage of the bomb seems almost inevitable. When the new bomb is used, a few things very likely to happen: hundreds of thousands will die, maybe more, the next World War will begin, countries will be destroyed, and the current alliances between countries may be broken. The bomb is an uncontrollable beast, running after its prey, not stopping for anything, or anyone, that is unfortunate enough to cross its path, whether it be an accident, or a choice. The next World War will be a nuclear war, most likely ending in complete devastation, thanks to the bomb’s Creator: Mankind.</p>
