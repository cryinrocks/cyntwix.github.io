					<p>I think absolutely nothing shows the transition I've undergone in the last few years than reading this weekly post from a class I had a few yeras ago. I was irrationally upset about my professor teaching "pseudoscience" in class as if it was fact. I was way too up my own STEM ass to have any sort of levity and just appreciate the novelty of such wacky ideas. If I had this lecture today, I'd probably be super excited to see my professor talk about something so refreshing. Who gives a shit if it's all bullfuck or not? Below is the direct submission I made:</p>
					<p>You mentioned something in class this week that bothered me quite a bit. You spoke for a while about the King Wen sequence of the I Ching and the discovery of the “time wave.” I’m an electrical engineering major who has taken multiple courses in physics, and I have never encountered such a phrase: “time wave.” I decided to look into it after class and what I found is nothing more than pseudoscience. </p>
					<p>The idea of creating a “time wave” was thought of by Terence McKenna, as part of his “novelty theory” which considered pseudoscience by the entire scientific community. McKenna had absolutely no formal background in physics or science; he studied ecology, resource conservation, and shamanism. McKenna became fascinated with fractals and the I Ching, specifically the King Wen sequence. He began to study them and eventually wrote a non-peer reviewed paper titled “Derivation of the Timewave from the King Wen Sequence of Hexagrams,” a paper that was not published by any reputable science journal (you can read this paper here: http://www.levity.com/eschaton/waveexplain.html). McKenna altered data he grabbed from the I Ching in arbitrary ways until it resulted in something that resembled a wave. He looked for patterns where patterns didn’t exist, and because he wanted to see something, he ended up seeing something that wasn’t there at all. He “found” a wave that would determine the pattern of human habit and novelty throughout time, all reaching a zero point where the world would end on December 21, 2012, which just so happened to line up with the end of the Mayan calendar. This produced massive panic in 2012 which, as we know, did not produce the end of the world. </p>
					<p>I’m not sure if you did full research into this, so if you have not, I would strongly recommend reading about it. There’s plenty of information I found just from a few simple Google searches. Reciting incorrect information to a large class does no good. It only infects the minds of people who don’t know enough about the subject to correct you. The level of confidence you spoke with even made me believe you for a brief moment. I had the idea to look deeper into it, but I’m sure many of my fellow classmates accepted your words as truth.</p>
