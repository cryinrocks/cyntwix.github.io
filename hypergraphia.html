					<p>Thermal radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is created by the movement of particles in a material. While we typically consider thermal radiation under conditions when a material is heated up, all matter produces some kind of thermal radiation. The movement of charged particles in an atom creates changing electric and magnetic fields due to the nature of charged particles. These fields in turn result in the emission of photons, which travel outwards from the material. These photons are the thermal radiation of the material. </p>
                    <p>A plot of the thermal spectrum of an object (a plot of thermal intensity vs wavelength) shows a peak intensity at some wavelength. This peak indicates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation that the object is emitting the most and is determined by the overall temperature of the object. This relationship can be seen in Wien’s Displacement Law. Temperatures of objects on earth, heated or otherwise, don’t reach such extreme temperatures as, and so by Wien’s Displacement Law, most of of thermal radiation seen on earth is in the infrared part of the spectrum.</p>
                    <p>Current designs of non-contact infrared thermometers measure the infrared radiation from a single point on an object and use that information to generalize the temperature for the entire object. The total power of the radiation is calculated by determining the intensity of the radiation at a range of wavelengths (from about .7μm to 14μm). The thermometer then considers that the temperature raised to the fourth power is proportional to this total power, as defined by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Our proposed design works differently. Instead of scanning a small range of the infrared spectrum, our thermometer will scan a much larger range, observing the intensity of radiation at each wavelength. This data would result in a single wavelength where the intensity is at its peak value. Wien’s Displacement Law says that there is a single temperature value where intensity would be peaked at that given wavelength. This would then allow us to determine the temperature of the object.</p>
                    <p>Some of the disadvantages for this new design are shared with typical design. Any dust or particles in the air or dust or dirt on the lens would yield an inaccurate reading. Additionally, different objects have different levels of emissivity. Objects with greater emissivity will return greater intensity for a given wavelength, which would yield an inaccurate temperature reading. While this will yield an error, however, it will be less of an error than a typical design. Due to the shape of thermal spectrum curve, our design of choosing a wavelength at the peak value will result in a temperature closer to the real value than averaging the power and doing a calculation. This is simply because for the spectral curves of two given temperatures, their peak wavelengths are more similar than the area under each curve. Typical non-contact thermometers are usually limited by assuming every object has an emissivity of .9, or have a difficult to adjust setting to control emissivity. Our thermometer would potentially be more accurate within these set limitations.</p>
                    <p>Women in film tend to take on secondary or supporting roles. The same goes for women in Shakespeare’s plays. Although some of his plays contain a female lead, his most renowned works are male-centric and the casts contain a majority of male characters. Not to mention that the actual casts, when performed live in Shakespeare’s time, were made up of entirely men. The portrayal of the extremely limited amount of female characters in his plays shows the sexist attitudes apparent in Shakespeare’s society and in his own work, namely in Hamlet.</p>
					<p>Throughout the play, Ophelia’s power is radically limited by the men in her life including her father and brother. In Act I Scene III, both Laertes and Polonius both tell Ophelia to stay away from Hamlet and that he only wants to sleep with her. Laertes says “Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes”(I.iii.38) meaning that although Ophelia may have a good set of morals, her actions with Hamlet will create a bad reputation that overshadows these morals. Using the word “virtue” in the context of his argument against sexual relations with Hamlet, Laertes implies that abstinence is equivalent to having good morals, and that in order to be respectable, she must wait until marriage for a relationship. Ophelia’s entire existence is boiled down to the common idea in the play that a woman is only worth anything if she is a virgin. She is reminded of this by Laertes when he says “The canker galls the infants of the spring/Too oft before their buttons be disclosed” (I.iii.39-40). The words “infants of the spring” were specifically chosen to portray a clichéd metaphor for female sexuality in that the “canker” will ruin the flower before it blooms.  The graphic comparison to flowers and deflowering turn Ophelia, a person who he is trying to keep a virgin, into a sexual object. This strange oxymoronic mentality of simultaneously sexualizing a woman while keeping her from sex is something that occurs throughout the play. Laertes’s strange and inappropriate advice only contributes to the sexist attitude that pervades Hamlet. </p>
					<p>This attitude also reveals itself not only in how other characters speak to Ophelia, but her place in the story as well. In Act III, Ophelia is shown to be a catalyst for drama and an overall shallow character. Hamlet speaks to Ophelia with blame and aggression during their first encounter, saying “I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God has given you one face and you make yourselves another” (III.i.135-136). Hamlet addresses Ophelia’s beauty other times throughout the play. It is only at this point in the play, when he is trying to insult her, that he attacks her physical appearance. He employs a double standard in which he wants her to enhance her physical beauty, but then insults her in saying she is lying and “painting” on another face when she does so. </p>
					<p>Additionally, she is used to enhance the drama of the play when she dies. At her funeral, Laertes and Hamlet turn against one another, and literally fight in her grave. This gives Laertes even more motivation to kill Hamlet, ultimately leading to the climax of the play. Ophelia is a one dimensional character that doesn’t seem to exist outside of Hamlet and the other men in the play, she is completely dependent on them and the drama of the plot seems to only depend on her. </p>
					<p>The intense focus of male writers on female sexuality and appearance reveals itself in Hamlet as Ophelia, one of only two main female characters, is at the receiving end of derogatory comments about her appearance and is subject to male standards of sexuality. It’s easy to say that these sexist attitudes were only characteristic to the culture of the past and that our society has outgrown them in exchange for more progressive ones. However this is not the case, and if we switch from examining the theater of the past to the modern movie industry, we can see too many similarities. </p>
					<p>If we look at the International Movie Database’s “Top 250” chart, which is a list that ranks the “best films of all time” based on a collected rating from users of the site, we can see how sexism still dominates in society. Out of the top ten movies on the list, arguably nine of them are male-centric, with the possible exception being Pulp Fiction—however even Mia Wallace is sexualized, with the film having an extended dialogue between main characters discussing her feet. If we look further down the list, we find Lawrence of Arabia, widely regarded as one of the best films of the twentieth century. This movie contains no women characters with dialogue. In fact, the only women seen in the movie are extras in the background of shots. </p>
					<p>Although the way in which visual entertainment has evolved, it seems as if we still haven’t strayed too far from Shakespeare’s “only men can act” rule. Female characters are twice as likely to have their appearance commented on than male characters, and female characters are twice as likely to be shown in a provocative way (Puchko). So not only does the sexualization of women still exist, it’s even more blatant and insulting than it was when Shakespeare used it. If a movie does happen to feature a female protagonist, they’re most often a love interest or a “damsel in distress.”</p>
					<p>Of course, exceptions to these norms do exist and are becoming more common. Though the movie industry is still male dominated, there have been movies that reflect on and redefine the roles women have in films. Ridley Scott’s famed Alien and Aliens, and even more recently, Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity which dominated 2013’s box office, are just some of more modern movies featuring incredibly strong female protagonists. Yet among these strong progressive films are more subtle about the change. The 2013 film Enemy, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is a good example of how a modern movie can subvert an archaic idea, that of demonizing and over-sexualizing women, and make it more realistic and less stereotypical.</p>
					<p>The film’s main character, Anthony, is plagued by psychological issues—depression, anxieties about commitment and fidelity, and multiple personalities that are used to move the plot. Anthony has a wife who loves him yet he finds himself visiting sex clubs and having affairs with other women. This setup is similar to that of Hamlet. Both feature a male down-on-his-luck protagonist and at least one beautiful girl that exists only as a side character for the sake of drama. It’s similar to Hamlet but also nothing new; this setup is entirely stereotypical. But upon a more in-depth analysis, it is evident that Enemy does something more progressive than its predecessors: it uses its clichés to subvert itself and the many other stories like it.</p>
					<p>Enemy has a heavy focus on symbolism. The most prominent symbol used are spiders, which represent women in the film. The frightening, perhaps disgusting connotation associated with spiders is essentially how Anthony feels about women and commitment. His fear of being dominated and controlled manifests itself in the visual of spiders. Yet while he fears women, he simultaneously lusts over them as he cheats on his wife and frequents sex clubs.This conflicting idea of over-sexualizing women while making them the enemy is a theme present in both Enemy and Hamlet, as previously mentioned. This scenario, of an emotionally disturbed man who has issues with women, is the set up of a stereotype that plagues not only sixteenth century theater, but also modern film. </p>
					<p>This stereotype, however, is destroyed as the movie progresses. In one scene in the movie, Anthony dreams of a feminine figure walking down a hallway, dressed in revealing clothing. The camera shifts to reveal her face and we see that the figure has the body of a woman but the face of a spider. This direct juxtaposition of a woman and an arachnid parallels Anthony’s mindset about women. This ridiculous association and visual is presented again at the end of the movie when Anthony goes to talk with his wife about his plans for that night because he wants to go out (secretly to a sex club). As he walks into the room his wife is in, he finds in her place a giant tarantula.</p>
					<p>Presenting women as literal spiders may upon first glance seem like a sexist metaphor. But upon further inspection, it is evident that this comparison is not a reflection of the women in the film, but rather a reflection of the main character. Upon first viewing of the film, it seems as though women really are the titular enemy because of their representation, yet the actual enemy is in fact Anthony himself.  He continues to keep the same, disgusting mindset about women and because of this he causes nothing but problems in his life and the lives of those he drags into his problems. In this way, Anthony is very similar to Hamlet. It is clear that Anthony has deep psychological and emotional issues, as does Hamlet, but in the case of Enemy the problems of the main character are not caused by anyone other than himself. Only Anthony adds drama to the story.</p>
					<p>Enemy begs to be analyzed due to the blatant metaphorical use of spiders and it is clear that the movie cannot simply be watched once. The presentation of spiders in the film is so shocking and surprising that it cannot go without analysis. Is the director trying to say that women are spiders? Do women turn into spiders? By using literal spiders, the director highlights and makes obvious the problem with the way women are portrayed in movies. </p>
					<p>In presenting a stereotyped ideal in a ridiculous and almost mocking fashion with huge spiders, Enemy, calls attention to a problem that has pervaded many plays and movies. The women in the movie are not, in fact, spiders nor do they cause any issues within the movie. The only character who creates problems is Anthony. Anthony is his own enemy and he creates the negative connection between women and spiders in his own mind.</p>
                    <p>Enemy presents itself on the surface as a cliche movie about a man who has issues with women and how women are the root of all his problems and only seem to cause drama. Yet this cliche very quickly is realized to be ridiculous and this realization can be furthered applied to movies as a whole. Enemy very obviously is not in the forefront of progressive movies that attack gender stereotypes, but in its own subtle way, it reflects on and calls attention to the cliched ways women are and have been portrayed in visual entertainment for centuries. </p>
                    <p>Movies are typically used as two-hour long periods of uninvolved leisure. Christopher Nolan challenges this idea with his effective use of foreshadowing and symbolism in his 2006 film The Prestige. The film is about two feuding magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, in the late nineteenth century. Christopher Nolan uses his film as a commentary on the way we watch movies, and in essence, consume literature. Nolan implies that there are two ways to view a film—the typical nonchalant viewing of a movie solely for entertainment or escapism, and the critical, focused, analytical viewing with the purpose to find deeper meanings and creative nuances implemented by the director.</p>
                    <p>The first line of dialogue in the movie is a voiceover of Alfred Borden speaking the words: “Are you watching closely?” The movie’s first line is self referencing—Nolan more than strongly encourages his audience to pay very close attention to the film, he almost demands it. The first line of the movie reveals that there is more to this movie than just a money-making blockbuster, and members of the audience should realize this and begin to pay attention. But they don’t.</p>
                    <p>Immediately before the delivery of this line, the first image Nolan presents his audience is a clearing in the woods with many top hats scattered over the pine needles and dead branches. The visual has no complimenting audio, so it’s clear that Nolan intended for the image to hold very specific significance. Yet, the hats do not seem to be anything necessarily special, they are just ordinary hats. It is unknown to the audience at the time, but the hats are actually involved with a pivotal moment in the film—so pivotal, in fact, that the secret of Robert Angier’s greatest trick is revealed by these hats. But Nolan quickly cuts from the hats to a shot of canaries in cages. The image of the hats is so surreal in comparison that it is dismissed as frivolous and ultimately forgotten. Seemingly unimportant details in Nolan’s film eventually prove to be very important symbols hinting at, sometimes nearly spoiling, the secrets and twists in the movie’s plot.</p>
                    <p>The subtle use of foreshadowing through these symbols is present through the entire film. The scene immediately after the initial shot of the hats consists of cuts between Robert Angier’s “The Real Transported Man” trick, and Cutter performing a trick with a canary for Alfred Borden’s daughter. During an initial viewing of the film, both of these events hold very obvious significance—Cutter explains the three parts of every magic trick and Angier’s death during his trick helps forward the plot by having Borden accused for his murder and thus establishing and initial conflict. We later learn that both of theses scenes in fact contain much more significance than initially perceived. In fact, the bird trick actually mimics “The Real Transported Man.” In each, a living thing is presented, disappears by dying, and then a copy of the original is made to reappear. The canaries act as symbols for Robert Angier and his clones, effectively giving away one of the movies tricks within the first ten minutes.</p>
                    <p>The birds are used once again, however this time they are used to frame the secret of Alfred Borden’s trick. The magician, Virgil, performs the same canary trick from earlier, and Borden, as his stagehand, notices a young boy crying in the audience. After the show, Borden consoles the boy, showing him the now dead canary’s double, and tells the him that the bird is fine. The boy simply asks, “[b]ut where’s his brother?” Just as Borden uses his twin brother, Fallon, in his trick as a double, the bird’s “brother” was its double as well. Furthermore, to help console the boy, Borden gives him a trick coin—the coin has a head on both sides—and tells the boy to “never show anyone.” The double-sided coin is once again resembling Borden and Fallon’s double lives, how even though they are different people, the people they interact on a daily basis don’t know the secret. Essentially, Borden and Fallon live their trick as their lives, and their lives as tricks.</p>
                    <p>While these symbols are the most significant to the foreshadowing in the film, Nolan subtly uses other symbols to create a more effective movie. While the canary trick highlights details about Angier’s and Borden’s greatest tricks, it also describes their ultimate downfalls. The canary that is killed during the trick dies from being crushed by the bars of its cage. Alfred Borden is hanged inside the prison that he was being held in. Robert Angier drowns himself in a tank of water. Both men died by being trapped in different types of cages, just like their canary counterpart. And as we revisited the canaries, we can also revisit the hats from the beginning of the film. When the film reaches the previously mentioned “pivotal point,” it is revealed that the hats are a result of Tesla’s cloning device Angier. later uses for his trick. However when we see the hats this time, two black cats are running among them, hissing and fighting. Black cats are universal symbols for bad luck, and this is just another example of that. The black cats are running throughout clones of top hats made by the same machine Angier would later use. There is bad luck among the clones, for Angier later dies as a result of using the cloning machine. And even another symbol is the knot Borden uses to bind Angier’s wife’s hands during the trick in which she dies. She drowns in the water tank because she is unable to untie Borden’s knot, which is called the Langford Double. The idea of doubles is prevalent throughout the film, from Borden’s twin to Angier’s hired double to the canary’s double to Angier’s clones, etc. The doubles contain an underlying element of demise. Each use of a double by the magicians results in either death or injury, and the use of this Langford Double knot results in the death of Angier’s wife as well.</p>
                    <p>Borden’s dialogue informs the audience of his extreme dedication to magic a few times throughout the film. Early on Borden informs Cutter and Angier that he has a trick that “no one else could do” except for him, referring to his trick with his identical twin brother. A short time after that, Borden explains famous magician Chung Ling Soo’s goldfish bowl trick to Angier. He tells Angier that the reason no one can figure out Soo’s trick is because he always fakes being a frail old man anytime he is seen in public. His trick requires “utter self sacrifice” in order for it to retain its wonder. Borden and his twin, Fallon, recognized the necessity of such sacrifices and made them as well—when Borden lost fingers from Angier’s trickery, Fallon cut his own off in order to preserve the trick. In fact, during the climax of the movie Borden says to Angier, “[s]acrifice, Robert. That’s the price of a good trick.” It is clear that Borden believes that true magic requires total devotion to the craft, and that the best tricks are the ones that come from this idea. He and Fallon live secret lives as the two brothers in order to protect the secret of their greatest trick.</p>
                    <p>Yet despite this necessary secrecy, the truth behind the lie is obvious to the viewers who are paying attention to the film, as reminded by Nolan at the beginning. Those who haven’t really been paying attention are confused by the truth of the film’s ending. The surprising reveal of how both magician’s tricks worked can seem stretched and forced, while in fact they are the complete opposite. Nolan had laid the groundwork for the mystery since the absolute start of the movie. He knew exactly what he was making and exactly how he wanted it presented. Nolan put deep thought into the creation of this film not only to highlight the casual way we tend to view films, but also because he created something great. In creating a movie about magicians, Nolan made himself a magician and his trick is the movie. </p>
                    <p>Nolan starts the movie with a voice-over narration by the character Cutter in which he informs the audience of the basic structure of a magic trick. According to Nolan, every magic trick is divided into three parts—the Pledge, in which the magician presents something seemingly ordinary to his audience, encouraging them to examine it to check the validity of his claim—the Turn, where the magician does the actual “magic,” making the object act in a way the audience knows is impossible—and finally, the Prestige, the final part of the trick, perhaps the best, in which the magician resolves the illusion in some grand fashion. The narration calls these three parts “acts,” like the traditional three-act structure of film. Nolan Pledges to the audience that the movie will be a film about magicians, Turns it by introducing the feud between Borden and Angier, and the film’s Prestige is the reveal of the magicians’ methods. </p>
                    <p>The overall goal of any magic trick is to fool the audience. A magician’s audience “want[s] to be fooled” because the real magic of a trick isn’t making something disappear. Rather, it is believing in the possibility that something so fantastic could be real. When watching The Prestige, an audience member willingly chooses to ignore Nolan’s request to pay close attention to the details. The film’s denouement coincides with its climax, and the secrets are finally unveiled. The satisfaction of discovering the truth during this moment is superior to having the secrets spoiled earlier on in the film which results in an overall more entertaining experience. By choosing to view the film in leisure, the film’s general audience confirms the natural tendency to passively consume movies and other forms of literature for the purpose of being entertained. Nolan recognized this tendency and created The Prestige, a film about magicians fooling their gullible audiences, to effectively criticize the general moviegoing audience’s unwillingness to analyze even when told to do so. A film’s director uses the medium to convey more substantial ideas that transcend the film itself, and a passive viewer would not recognize these ideas and ultimately miss out on the true meaning of the film.</p>
                    <p>Blunt weapons. Likely the first kind of weapons developed by man, these were often made of bone, wood, or rock. Capable of crushing a skull with a single blow, or bruising the extremities of the adversary, blunted weapons proved to be very deadly and unmatched. Edged weapons. The next progression is found with swords and spears. A slice could turn one part into two, separate head from shoulders. A single thrust could impale, puncturing organs and tissues. Gunpowder. Used by infantry, gunpowder could send small projectiles of lead deep into a man’s skull, completely devastating everything in its path. Used by artillery, gunpowder could send an enormous mass into an enemy congregation, leaving no man standing. Nuclear weapons. The most powerful weapons available today. Capable of wiping out entire cities, even some countries, and leave dangerous residue behind so you do not forget its power. The advancement of weaponry has led to this, and it has gone too far. The bomb is too powerful; we should never have created it.</p>
                    <p>The beginnings of the nuclear bomb lie with two chemists from Germany, Fritz Strassmann and Otto Hahn. They were the first people to split the nuclei of some of the atoms in a sample of Uranium. Using this science, the United States began a project to develop the most dangerous weapon in history. The project was called the Manhattan Project, and was led by J. Robert Oppenheimer. The project strived to develop the first nuclear weapons in human history. They spent countless hours researching and completing calculations to build the bomb; they had no idea what they were creating. The first bomb dropped, codenamed “Trinity,” exceeded the expectations, creating a blast comparable to many kilotons (1 kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 pounds of TNT). This project led to the creations of Fat Man and Little Boy, the two bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II in the Pacific. These two bombs wiped out two cities completely, killing over a hundred thousand people. This was not an act of nature, or by a God, this was caused by mankind.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear weapons can be classified into two types: Atomic bombs, and Hydrogen bombs. While both harness the immense power of atoms, they are very different. Atomic bombs are powered by a process called nuclear fission. This involves rapidly moving neutrons that collide with the nucleus, splitting in two and setting more neutrons free to split other nuclei. When a nucleus is split, energy capable of wiping out city blocks is released. This type of bomb was used for this purpose with the utter destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The other type are Hydrogen Bombs. These bombs utilize nuclear fusion, a process that collides hydrogen particles and fuses them together to create helium. The same process occurs on the sun and requires incredibly high temperatures. On Earth, the only way to reach these temperatures is by detonating an atomic bomb. Hydrogen bombs have been tested, but never used against other humans. The explosive output of a hydrogen bomb is about 1,000 times larger than an atomic bomb. If one were to be launched against another country, the effects would be so devastating that the instigator will never be forgiven. Possibly millions of casualties would be a result, plus years of reconstruction and huge safety measurements would have to be devoted to recreating what was so easily taken away by a creation of man.</p>
                    <p>After a strike, nuclear weapons leave devastating after effects. Cities collapse, leaving heaps of rubble everywhere. The few survivors find their homes gone, destroyed; they need a place to wait for help to arrive, if it arrives before they die from radiation. Many families are torn apart, having their loved ones perish in the radiation. The few survivors must continue to live in the discarded husk of the city they once lived in, maybe grew up in. What they knew before no longer exists thanks to the bomb. The Ground Zero is bombarded with the initial radiation from the blast, x-rays and gamma rays. Afterwards, nuclear fallout radiation, or delayed radiation, remains near the blast zone and continuously harms many victims. The radiation cannot be sensed by a human, which makes it even more dangerous. Large amounts of radiation often kill its victims painfully. However, some do not die initially and suffer from cancer, leukemia, birth defects, or sterility. For those with radiation sickness, no “cure all” drug exists; the process to cure a patient can be very difficult, and often result in failure.</p>
                    <p>The United States has run tests on the radiation given off from a nuclear explosion. In the 1950’s, the United States started to test new bombs, including hydrogen bombs, on islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. One group of islands in particular were the Marshall Islands. In 1954, a hydrogen bomb testing was executed, depositing enormous amounts of radiation and fallout. Three years later, the United States decided it was safe to move the island’s residents back. These people were then exposed to more than three times the radiation given off from the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Exposed to these terrible environments, the islanders felt unsafe and decided to move off of the island. The United States incorrectly told the islanders that it would be safe to move back; they had no idea exactly how badly a nuclear weapon can destroy a society. The weapons are terribly dangerous, and result in no positive outcomes, even from testing.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the bomb’s radiation, the bomb has many other devastating effects. It can create enormous temperatures that burn everything in its path; the explosion can be so bright that it blinds spectators; its shock wave travels outward from the blast zone, remaining equidistant at all times. The wave pummels into everything it touches at close to the speed of sound– 1,100 feet per second. The blast is capable of capable of destroying houses and tall buildings with little effort. Bombarding the structures with upwards of 50 pounds per square inch, the pressure is enough to demolish cement and disintegrate mortar. Many unlucky victims do not die from the blast, but from the collapsing buildings. </p>
                    <p>Too many negative aspects of nuclear weapons overpower the few positive ones– capability of ending wars, establishing military superiority, etc. The bombs are largely vessels for Death, harbingers of destruction and doom. Although only two bombs have been used to wipe out a mass of humans, it does not mean that it will not happen again. In fact, with research being conducted to develop new, stronger bombs, another usage of the bomb seems almost inevitable. When the new bomb is used, a few things very likely to happen: hundreds of thousands will die, maybe more, the next World War will begin, countries will be destroyed, and the current alliances between countries may be broken. The bomb is an uncontrollable beast, running after its prey, not stopping for anything, or anyone, that is unfortunate enough to cross its path, whether it be an accident, or a choice. The next World War will be a nuclear war, most likely ending in complete devastation, thanks to the bomb’s Creator: Mankind.</p>
                    <p>Throughout high school, marching band remained as a steady constant in my life. Because of its nearly year-round dedication, there was rarely a time that the band wasn’t rehearsing or doing something together as a group. Band activities were so frequent that nearly all of my free time was spent with the marching band and it absorbed me. Marching band was by far the most influential of all the extracurricular activities I was a part of and participating in band in college would allow me to continue being part of such an amazing community.</p>
                    <p>Ok, I’m gonna approach this by first laying out some certain facts and truths, and then lead into some uncertainties and conjectures. I think that’s the best way to format something like this since so much has probably been lost in confusion. So let’s jump into the facts.</p>
                    <p>Fact: We had a physical encounter kickstarted by confused romantic feelings from both of us. It was weird but we both agreed that it didn’t necessarily mean anything and definitely didn’t mean we were now in a relationship. We’d move forward and if something was gonna happen, so be it, something was gonna happen. Nothing was gonna be forced and nothing was gonna be assumed.</p>
                    <p>Fact: A bunch of shit involving the new knowledge that you won’t be graduating this semester was dumped on you right after our weird encounter. I spoke with you about your thoughts and wanted to talk with you about it, since this was a big deal and I would’ve liked someone to talk with me about it if the roles were reversed. This was acting as a friend.</p>
                    <p>Fact: In the days after our encounter, we were both still unsure. I was unsure. I hadn’t quite realized the fact yet that I had no desire to be romantically/sexually/whatever-ly involved with a partner in any sense of the word. But to come to a realization like this, you’re gonna have to stumble through events first in order to actually see how you feel. The moments of intimacy we shared during that week were a result of my confusion in how I felt personally. I understand this likely led you on and produced strange feelings. This was not my intention. These actions were admittedly selfish, and as I came to realize the selfishness, I became more uncomfortable with them, ultimately stopping.</p>
                    <p>Fact: You expressed to me that you began to feel a dependency on the conversations we’d have throughout the day. This scared me. This was beginning to feel like some sort of romantic relationship that I was discovering I wanted no part in. </p>
                    <p>Fact: You spoke to me about being incredibly stressed out. You have a lot a stuff going on that involve really important life decisions that you have to make/figure out for yourself. I didn’t want to feel responsible for any actions you might make regarding these decisions. I didn’t want these feelings of dependency you expressed interfere with actually important decisions. This combined with another fact: [We barely know/knew each other. We’d seen each other in person less than five times before the weird night and only shallowly talked online] really made me afraid that you could make a decision you might regret later. You said to me in the aftermath of finding out you’d be spending another semester here, something along the lines of: “Now at least I have more time to spend with you.” I hope you can see why I wanted to reduce contact.</p>
                    <p>Fact: We had another weird conversation spurred by you being concerned about a joke facebook status I made. This broke the incredibly brief session of no-contact I wanted to have to both minimize the stress you were under and maximize the fun we could have at the anime convention. In this conversation I made it clear that I did not want any sort of romantic goal from this and you told me you never wanted that either. This didn’t seem true to me as everything, especially what you said to me on that first Saturday, contradicted it. Among other specific instances, this raised some red flags in my head. Our conversation continued and we were talking just like regular friends might do on occasion. Admittedly it was much longer than the conversations I have with even my closest friends. I chalked it off as whatever.</p>
                    <p>Fact: At the convention, you were relentlessly messaging me to meet up. I’ll admit to screening a lot of your messages. There were definitely times when we could’ve met up even though I said it wasn’t possible. The truth is that I wanted to spend time with my incredibly close friends who I’ve known for long time and mean a lot to me. I didn’t want the stress of all the interactions I’ve had with you lately seeping into this day for me. Yet it still did from the messages you were sending. There was a good chunk of time during the day where I talked to my friends about the situation. They asked me about it because I was apparently visibly uneasy and nervous and stressed. I owed it to them to explain the situation and they said the best move would be to just not really respond to you anymore. I agreed this was for the better.</p>
                    <p>Fact: I now started to become very stressed out from you sending messages. I wasn’t sure how to respond or what to say to you, I just wanted to not have to think about it at all. I never wanted to get myself wrapped up in some situation like this. There was no way I could’ve predicted that this is the path that I set out on by inviting you over that first Saturday. There were other things I’d rather be stressed out about or think about throughout the day.</p>
                    <p>Fact: I shared details about my fight with depression with you. This is not something special, nearly everyone in my life knows. I don’t keep this private. Maybe you thought it was something special that I shared with you but that’s just not how it is. I know mental health can be a touchy and weird subject for a lot of people but I’m very comfortable with my mental health. I’ve gone through years of therapy to learn acceptance and methods to fight it and get through the day/week/month/year. I’m very proud of how far I’ve come. I understand that you feel like you want to help me and that you need to help me and that I’m not ok. While sure, maybe I’m “not okay,” it’s totally fucking fine that I feel sad. This is nothing new for me. And to be honest, the things that K has told me you’ve said about wanting to make sure I’m fine make me feel actually bad. They make me feel like I need pity and I need help. They make me feel like I should feel weak and sorry for myself. This is not the truth though. This is far from the truth.</p>
                    <p>Fact: Despite whatever tone may come across through my words here, I’m not angry at you or upset with you or really feel any negative feelings towards you other than annoyance. I’m annoyed that things had to go this way. I’m annoyed that a friendship we could’ve had is now tainted by this stupid situation that’s been blow way more out of proportion that it ever deserved to be. If things would’ve just stayed normal after a one-off weird interaction that would’ve been great. Weirder things happen. Friends fuck, regret it, and continue to be friends without ever getting weird and clingy about it. </p>
                    <p>This leads into:</p>
                    <p>Uncertainty: I’m not sure about how you actually feel about me. You told me this has nothing to do with a romantic relationship anymore but I have a very strong feeling that you’re not being truthful about this. Other people agree as well. I think you’re a little too obsessed with me and that’s not okay in my book. If we were just regular old pals, there are a lot of things you wouldn’t be doing. Regular friends don’t act in a lot of these ways.</p>
                    <p>Uncertainty: I don’t know what things are gonna be like moving forward. I think I’d prefer it if you stopped feeling like you needed to message me or message other people about me. It sounds like for the most part you’ve been sending inquiries out to our mutual friends to see if I’m “doing alright” or whatever. Let me put this hardset in some concrete: I’m fine, there’s absolutely no need to ever worry about me. Don’t take this the wrong way, but there’s nothing you can do for me even if I wasn’t fine. The way my brain is wired, there’s not much anything anyone can do for me if I’m not fine. I learned this through years of therapy and introspection and meditation. This is how my person is setup. There’s no need to worry about me. If we still end up physically in the same spot, that’s totally fine with me. We were able to function properly at wsoft things before any of this happened. If you really are just concerned about my depression, and not actually obsessed with me, then we can go back to that norm if you want. I’m ok with continuing that type of friendship. </p>
                    <p>Bottom line: I’m ok. I don’t want you to be obsessed with me. I don’t feel like I deserve this much of your attention after the minimal amount of interactions we’ve had and time we’ve known each other. I don’t feel like you deserve to be thinking about me this much either. This is such stupid stress and I’m very sorry for all the grief it’s likely caused you. I wish it never had to be like that in the first place.</p>
                    <p>You told me you were gonna seek out therapy and I think that is an incredibly brave and wise decision. Lots of therapists suck, but if you get a good one they can be so beneficial. I’m very glad you didn’t know me last year or the year previous because I was a wreck of a person. If it seems like I’m well put together now, that’s because of the therapy I went through and the fighting I’ve done for self improvement. It can be an incredibly transformative experience and I wish you so much luck and good fortune if you pursue this path.</p>
                    <p>I’m not upset about anything that has happened. Life gets weird sometimes and you just gotta accept that. However, while I’m not personally upset about anything, I do feel bad for others. I feel bad that our friendship had to weave its way into wrapping K, S, D, H, and T’s lives (among others, I don’t know how many people you’ve discussed this with). I feel very bad that these individuals had to deal with the stupid shit that we created. Some of these people have expressed their own stress due to our stress having to exist in the first place. This has been incredibly unfair to all of them. I’ve apologized on numerous occasions since I never wished for anything like this to happen.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly though, I feel bad that you’ve had to deal with this shit as well. We both have faults in this game, and I’m very sorry for all the negative contributions I’ve made to steer this even more off the deep end. There’s no reason this should’ve gotten so big and I take some responsibility for that. I’m deeply sorry.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward, I don’t think we need to discuss this in person whatsoever. Ideally, I’d like you to carefully read these words, many times over in fact, and not discuss this with anyone else. Please don’t turn to a third party for support and advice. This is not about anyone else anymore, this is just about you and I. We’ve both caused too much stress to our friends and making any more is unfair and stupid and dumb. I know you have a lot of people in your support network, but for once let’s try to not go for them. This is a you and me topic. Let’s keep it that way from here on out. If you can do one thing for me, it’s this.</p>
                    <p>So read through all this a few times if you need to. At the end of it, if you want to share some feelings/thoughts with me, please do so. I’d hate it if you were unfairly shut out from sharing your voice. However, be aware that I won’t make a response to that. If you respond to me here, that will be the end of our discourse. Know that I’ll read everything you write, but that’ll be it.</p>
                    <p>I don’t want you to feel like you need to hide from me or avoid me or limit yourself from attending things because there’s a chance I’ll be there. I definitely won’t be acting this way about you, so I wouldn’t want you to live your life inhibited by this if it would mean you not getting to experience/enjoy/attend/whatever things you want to do. When we run into each other moving forward past this, I hope it’ll be with smiles and friendship. If it can’t be this way though, I understand. At the end of the day I cannot speak for you or make decisions for you. You’re your own powerful person.</p>
                    <p>Stay strong, you have a lot going for you and I hope you can learn to see these things. All the best moving forward.</p>
                    <p>Watching the “Negative Trend Live 1978” video in class put the punk scene into perspective better than anything else we’ve watched or read in class thus far. Seeing the underproduced home-video style recordings of the group give a truly “uncut” look into their lives and the scene. There wasn’t anything to hide about their absurdity; they really just didn’t give a shit. The guy who shoved the cigarette butt in his nose and said it had some ulterior meaning is a perfect example of this. The style of the video reminded me of This is Spinal Tap, except instead of being satire, it’s real.</p>
                    <p>While not necessarily to this extent, I still feel like the punk scene exists today more so than the hippie scene exists. Moshing is still incredibly popular with a certain type of people and dressing that was is still very much present. It’ll be interesting to see if punk actually “died” the way hippies killed off their movement. I feel like it’s more as if punk just sort of faded out into a certain level of obscurity, one that’s not totally gone, just sort of existing in the background. However, mentioning the background must mean that there is a foreground where another movement has taken over, yet I still cannot put my finger on what that subculture is. It’s something I’ve been thinking about since we began this course and have yet to find an answer. Frankly it’s pretty frustrating but perhaps we’re not done talking in class and the answer will be revealed this week.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this report is to introduce the underlying concepts behind energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy on a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDS) and wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence (WDXRF). The two techniques will be compared and contrasted and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique will be addressed.</p>
					<p>The underlying process between these two different techniques is largely the same. The sample you want to know the composition of is bombarded with some sort of excitation; SEM-EDS utilizes a beam of electrons and WDXRF utilizes a beam of X-rays. This beam excites ground state electrons in atoms, causing them to leave their orbits and result in a hole. This hole must be filled, so an electron at a higher energy level drops down to fill the hole. In doing so, the electron releases energy as X-rays. Detectors set up around the sample pick up these X-rays and measure their wavelength and frequency. </p>
					<p>Each element has its own characteristic energy levels and therefore characteristic amounts of energy released when moving an electron from an excited state to the ground state. A spectral plot of all the energies measured by the X-ray detectors results in visible peaks at certain values. The energy values for these peaks are unique to specific elements. Therefore, analyzing these peaks can tell you the composition of your sample. WDXRF uses Bragg's Law to determine the structure and therefore the identity of the material. The X-ray detectors can identity the angle the X-ray was emitted from the material. From this data, unique information about the internal structure of the material is known and the identity of the material can be identified. </p>
					<p>The two techniques use a very similar underlying technique as mentioned previously. The major difference between the two is that SEM-EDS uses a beam of electrons and WDXRF uses a beam of X-rays. Additionally, a WDXRF device will use Bragg’s Law to additionally determine the identity of a material.</p>
                    <p>These two methods are the leading methods for determining elemental composition. They are nearly universally used in labs and understood by most engineers in the field. This makes it a wise choice to use either of the methods. Despite their popularity, however, there are a few drawbacks for each technique. WDXRF devices typically have a higher resolution for their data due to how they collect data: it is separated by wavelength due to Bragg’s Law. This allows for more distinguishable data than could be obtained from a SEM-EDS device. However, the drawback for this is that only a single element can be analyzed at a time. In order to look at an entire spectral range of a material, a SEM-EDS device should be used instead. Either device can be used for identification, but each one works better in slightly different circumstances and this should be taken into consideration for a final decision on which technique to use.</p>
                    <p>1.2 million years ago, the Yellowstone volcano erupted for a second time. This massive eruption expelled sixty-seven cubic miles of volcanic ash into the air above eastern Idaho, eventually settling down in thicknesses up to 1,000 feet. Standing in the caldera of the eruption, named Henry’s Fork Caldera, the twenty-three mile diameter ridge is visible on the horizon. The slopes are rolling and gradual, worn down from years of erosion and have blended into the landscape with time. The hotspot currently located beneath Yellowstone was once in eastern Idaho, where the Henry’s Fork Caldera currently sits. The caldera was created when the crust collapses after the release of pressurized magma during the eruption. The crust collapses on itself into a large bowl-shaped crater.</p>
                    <p>The second super volcanic eruption of the Yellowstone volcano deposited rock across the region. A beautiful place to see some of these rocks are at Upper Mesa Falls. The rocks at these falls are primarily of two types: basalt and rhyolite tuff. Initially this seems strange. How can these two types of volcanic rock that typically occur under very different circumstances exist together? Further inspection of the rocks yields the answer. The rhyolite tuff is welded and very consolidated which is indicative of ash flow tuff. This rock can be dated to the time of the second Yellowstone eruption that created the Henry’s Fork Caldera at around 1.2 million years. Further down the Snake River at Lower Mesa Falls, the walls of rhyolite tuff and beds of basalt are clearly visible. Here it can be seen that the basalt clearly lies on top of the rhyolite, indicating that it must be younger. The rock can be dated to about twenty-five thousand years ago and can be classified as post-caldera volcanic rock, meaning it originated from volcanic activity after the latest super volcanic eruption. At the Lower Mesa Falls, the rhyolite tuff composing the walls of the river had vertical jointing, which was caused by uneven cooling in the rock.</p>
                    <p>Further into the crater along the banks of the Warm River were two very distinct types of rock. More of the rhyolite ash flow tuff was present, but so was rhyolite air fall tuff. Ash flow tuff is welded and made of highly compressed ash with flattened pieces of pumice that formed under high temperatures during a pyroclastic flow. Air fall tuff is much less consolidated and crumbly forming from ash in the air settling onto the ground. The ash that composes these rocks is made of pumice, volcanic glass shards, and mineral crystals such as quartz, feldspar, and biotite.</p>
                    <p>The geology of the eastern Idaho area has a lot of volcanic history. While the hotspot was once underneath this area, the crust has moved and the hotspot is now located underneath Yellowstone. A volcanic eruption the size, or larger, of the one that created the Henry’s Fork Caldera is imminent. The present geology could be erased over by this eruption, but new geology would emerge. The earth is always in flux and it’s very humbling to know that what we see today will only be around for a brief moment in the whole of Earth’s history.</p>
                    <p>Kurt Vonnegut is known for writing science fiction novels. The genre is usually left behind when it comes to literary merit but Vonnegut writes in a way which pushes his novels to the top. He often writes about seemingly plausible events set in a world of fantasy. While the fantasy parts of his stories may be out there, the parts about the extreme banality of everyday life are timeless and persist into the realm of classic novels.</p>
                    <p>When Vonnegut first published Breakfast of Champions in 1973 it did not immediately adopt “classic” status. Time passed and the novel slowly revealed itself to be one that stuck around. Instead of being lost to the dusty back shelves of libraries across the country, it was republished again and again and became known as some of Vonnegut’s best writing. The reason for the novel’s persistence is most likely how normal a lot of it is. There are sections of the novel that don’t do anything to contribute to the plot, yet still manage to resonate. Vonnegut will take time to include sentences like “Up ahead was a white man hitchhiking with his pregnant wife and nine children” (127). It’s essentially unnecessary to the plot of the novel, yet it, as well as many other similar cases, are included by Vonnegut and make the novel unique. This oxymoronic unique banality of Vonnegut’s writing allowed Breakfast of Champions to stick around and become a classic.</p>
                    <p>Thou says that thou shalt do these acts,</p>
                    <p>Yet I do not want thou to do such things.</p>
                    <p>We have split up, it is time to relax.</p>
                    <p>Forget me and the songs we used to sing.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I do not wish for thou to harm thyself.</p>
                    <p>While I might not like things that thou hast done,</p>
                    <p>We both possess our own amount of wealth</p>
                    <p>And I do not wish for such deeds wanton.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>As we progress through the rest of our lives,</p>
                    <p>I wish thee to forget that I exist.</p>
                    <p>Thou shalt find new love and thine love will thrive,</p>
                    <p>Think not of my face when thine love doth kiss.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>While I loved thou at some point in the past,</p>
                    <p>I just wish for you to leave me at last.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, I played in the Metropolitan Youth Symphony Orchestra in Detroit for the General Assembly of the First Presbyterian Church. I’m not religious, so I had no idea what to expect. I knew how the orchestra would sound but I was not expecting the sound of voices from the audience. The mass had an attendance of about five thousand people, and the sound of their combined voices was astounding.</p>
                    <p>Religion was not present in my life growing up, so I never grasped the appeal of worship. However in that moment, it became more clear. I realized religion isn’t so much about worshiping a certain deity, but the communities and fellowships existing within a church. There is something uplifting about thousands of people celebrating a single cause. It was spiritual in a way that wasn’t religious, but rather in the sense that it enlightened me with new ideas about religion. Witnessing a large group of people participating in the same event stirred something inside me that made me want to join them. Not because I was suddenly converted, but because at the root of the congregation was something inherently human.</p>
                    <p>I realized that instead of playing the music for the congregation, I was playing it with them. The service transformed into a sublime experience, transcending differences in faith and becoming a celebration of humanity. I was expecting to simply attend the service, play, and leave. Instead, I was swept into something greater and experienced something unique and long lasting.</p>
                    <p>James took a step back and looked at his bedroom wall, the afternoon light shining upon the freshly painted wall. Wiping the red paint off his hands with a dirty rag, James sighed. He’d lived in his suburban home since birth and this was the first time his room had been repainted. The previous beige had been a comforting color through his childhood, but he felt like he really identified with the new red.</p>
					<p>James set his roller down in the paint tray, flipped the switch for the lights off, and walked out of his room. The sunlight streamed through the windows in his home as he walked to the kitchen to grab a snack. He grabbed a bag of microwave popcorn from the top shelf, put it in the microwave, and slammed the door. He cringed at the loud band, expecting his mother to yell at him to stop making so much noise, but no yelling came. His reaction was one of instinct, completely forgetting that his parents were out of town for his younger sister’s soccer tournament.</p>
					<p>He pushed the popcorn button on the microwave and sat down at the kitchen table as the machine whirred behind him. Tonight was a big night. They were finally going to do it, after all of these years. With his entire family gone for the weekend, it was a perfect opportunity to have his friends over and they can finally close the book they opened four years ago as freshmen in high school. They had all agreed to open the time capsule after they graduated, and now that they were going off to college in just a few short months, it was time to see what their past-selves had to say.</p>
					<p>The microwave beeped and James got up. He took the bag over to the couch and switched on the TV. He needed to kill some time before everyone came over later, so James flipped through the guide on the TV. There was a Kubrick marathon on and James relaxed deeper into the couch, popcorn in hand, and realized how much he enjoyed this current freedom.</p>
					<p>The demand for solar cell technology will greatly rise in the upcoming years. Currently, there are four major types of solar cells: Cadmium Telluride, Triple-Junction, Silicon, and Organic. The purpose of this brief paper is to discuss two of these: silicon and organic. The way each technology converts light into electricity, the underlying quantum physics behind each type of cell, and their similarities and differences will be covered.</p>
                    <p>A silicon solar cell contains a p-n junction, dividing the cell into a negatively charged part and a positively charged part with a barrier in between them that not all electrons can freely move across. When a photon collides with a silicon solar cell it is either absorbed, reflected, or passes through the material depending on the energy of the photon. If the photon’s energy is greater than the band gap of silicon, then the photon is absorbed and its energy is passed to a valence band electron. This excited electron is knocked free and due to the because of the p-n junction, is forced to move in a single direction towards the positively charged p-type silicon. This separation of charge creates a potential difference, a voltage, and if the cell is connected in a circuit, charge will flow creating an electric current. </p>
                    <p>Silicon solar cells entirely rely on quantum mechanics to work. Photons are not considered part of classical physics, so without light behaving as particles solar cells would not work. The same thing applies to the existence of a band gap, a concept not able to be explained by classical physics. However, the most important part is the p-n junction design of the solar cell. N-type and p-type silicon are defined by the existence of electron holes in each, with n-type having more electrons than holes and p-type having more holes than electrons. Electron holes are a result of quantized energy states that electrons can occupy, once again a concept not covered by classical physics.</p>
                    <p>Organic solar cells are made up of organic polymers rather than semiconductors. Therefore, there isn’t a p-n junction and the cell must work a different way. Instead of p-type and n-type materials, an organic solar cell contains electron donor and electron acceptor materials. These materials contain delocalized bonds that are capable of moving electrons down long chains of the polymer.  When the energy is absorbed, a excitron state is created. This is the presence of an electron and electron hole in the polymers. The excitron is able to move along the polymers and jumps through the bandgap of the two polymers to the acceptor molecule. The charge carrier is then transferred along the polymer chains to electrodes which are then used in circuits.</p>
                    <p>Much like in silicon solar cells, organic cells also rely on the quantum nature of photons, band gaps, and electron holes to function. In certain bonds between atoms, math on the wave function yields hybridized pz orbitals that become delocalized from each other. These hybridizations are defined and determined by the wave function, the defining function of quantum mechanics.</p>
                    <p>When discussing strengths and weaknesses of solar panels, the most important aspect to focus on is their efficiency. Typical p-n junction silicon solar cells have an efficiency of about 33%, meaning 33% of light energy is successfully converted into electricity. Organic solar cells, on the other hand, have a typical efficiency of about only 10-15%. Currently, silicon solar cells are much more efficient but research into organic solar cell technology has resulted in efficiencies around 75%. In the future, organic solar cells may prove to be a much better option than silicon cells. Currently, Organic cells are much cheaper to produce than silicon cells and also are flexible so they can fit to a contour. Silicon cells also have a much longer lifespan than organic cells.</p>
                    <p>Organic solar cells are not as commercially available as silicon cell mostly due to their relative newness. Because of this, the manufacturing industry for organic cells is very small. Most cells made are made in and for labs to conduct research. However, organic cells are very easy to manufacture which makes them cost much less than silicon cells. Silicon cells have been around for half a century and therefore have a large manufacturing base. They are produced on the scale of small cells for watches to the scale of large arrays for mass power generation on solar farms.</p>
					<p>I think absolutely nothing shows the transition I've undergone in the last few years than reading this weekly post from a class I had a few years ago. I was irrationally upset about my professor teaching "pseudoscience" in class as if it was fact. I was way too up my own STEM ass to have any sort of levity and just appreciate the novelty of such wacky ideas. If I had this lecture today, I'd probably be super excited to see my professor talk about something so refreshing. Who gives a shit if it's all bullfuck or not? Below is the direct submission I made:</p>
					<p>You mentioned something in class this week that bothered me quite a bit. You spoke for a while about the King Wen sequence of the I Ching and the discovery of the “time wave.” I’m an electrical engineering major who has taken multiple courses in physics, and I have never encountered such a phrase: “time wave.” I decided to look into it after class and what I found is nothing more than pseudoscience. </p>
					<p>The idea of creating a “time wave” was thought of by Terence McKenna, as part of his “novelty theory” which considered pseudoscience by the entire scientific community. McKenna had absolutely no formal background in physics or science; he studied ecology, resource conservation, and shamanism. McKenna became fascinated with fractals and the I Ching, specifically the King Wen sequence. He began to study them and eventually wrote a non-peer reviewed paper titled “Derivation of the Timewave from the King Wen Sequence of Hexagrams,” a paper that was not published by any reputable science journal (you can read this paper here: http://www.levity.com/eschaton/waveexplain.html). McKenna altered data he grabbed from the I Ching in arbitrary ways until it resulted in something that resembled a wave. He looked for patterns where patterns didn’t exist, and because he wanted to see something, he ended up seeing something that wasn’t there at all. He “found” a wave that would determine the pattern of human habit and novelty throughout time, all reaching a zero point where the world would end on December 21, 2012, which just so happened to line up with the end of the Mayan calendar. This produced massive panic in 2012 which, as we know, did not produce the end of the world. </p>
					<p>I’m not sure if you did full research into this, so if you have not, I would strongly recommend reading about it. There’s plenty of information I found just from a few simple Google searches. Reciting incorrect information to a large class does no good. It only infects the minds of people who don’t know enough about the subject to correct you. The level of confidence you spoke with even made me believe you for a brief moment. I had the idea to look deeper into it, but I’m sure many of my fellow classmates accepted your words as truth.</p>
					<p>American novelist Stephen King has gained quite a reputation since the release of his first novel, Carrie,  in 1974. His novels often focus on the supernatural; children with psychic powers, time travel, and alternate dimensions have been core elements for many of his books. After being in the public eye for more than 40 years, many have wondered how he can publish at least one book every year and have them still be of relatively high quality; popular author George R. R. Martin is quoted asking King “How the fuck do you write so many books so fast?” (Atkins). This has led many to believe King is somehow an embodiment of what he writes about, that he possesses magical powers and abilities of his own. </p>
                    <p>Upon a closer examination of King, we can see similarities between him and ancient Egyptian sorcerers. Perhaps the most famous of ancient Egyptian magic is the Book of the Dead, a set of spells that served as instructions to guide a soul through the afterlife. These spells were written down onto papyri or even physically carved into the walls of pyramids as it was believed that magic had no power until it was contained in written words. This idea persisted Egypt and can be seen in the popularity of Grimoires among magicians and even exists as a current magical stereotype (the common idea of a Spell Book in fantasy stories such as Harry Potter).</p>
                    <p>Seeing as how King is a writer, this connection is very apparent. King has written his own library of grimoires to contain his magical ideas and spells, many of which deal with the idea of death and the afterlife. Notable examples include Pet Sematary and King’s magnum opus, The Dark Tower. Sematary provides instructions to its main character on how to resurrect his deceased cat, and eventually his own son. This necromancy goes beyond Egyptian magic and reaches into the magic of Roman witches, specifically Erictho’s resurrection of Sextus Pompey in Lucian’s Pharsalia (Ogden 121-124).</p>
                    <p>In The Dark Tower, there is an overarching idea that when someone dies in this world, they awaken in another, called Mid-World; for example, a young boy was run over by a car in Manhattan and woke up in a new land but with his old body and memories. This movement between worlds is reminiscent of the Egyptian ideas of Ka and Ba; coincidentally (?) the word Ka exists in Mid-World, defined by The Dark Tower Wiki (DTW) as being “a mysterious force that leads all living (and unliving) creatures” and also “the will of Gan” (DTW: Ka). Gan is a godlike figure in the universe that is said to have arisen from dark waters and “spun the physical universe from his navel” (DTW: Gan); in this way Gan is similar to Atum and the Heliopolitan creation myth.</p>
                    <p>In the last volume of The Dark Tower, King writes himself into the story as a character that must be saved from death, as he is “able to channel the spirit of Gan” (DTW: Stephen King (Character)) and the world would end with his death. In both real life and the novel, King narrowly escaped being hit by a van that would have ended his life. He should have died and he was very lucky to have survived. King uses supernatural explanations in The Dark Tower to explain to his readers why he did not and could not die: it was necessary for him to continue channeling Gan by writing his novels. This idea of an individual channeling a god is present in gnosticism, which was popular Roman sorcerers like Simon Magus.</p>
                    <p>These individuals often acted as oracles, telling fortunes and the future. Interestingly, some people believe that King can actually predict the future, much like these ancient oracles. An article by Michael Goodspeed claims King predicted Columbine in his novel Rage and the 9/11 terrorist attacks in his novel The Running Man (Goodspeed). Whether or not King possesses the ability to predict the future is unknown, but there are definitely similarities between these novels and the real-life events. Overall, there are definitely many connections between Stephen King and magic of the ancient world. Is there any legitimacy behind these connections? It’s impossible to know for sure. King is a mysterious man, living in his spooky Maine mansion in relative isolation — much like Roman magicians who lived alone or in the desert — churning out novel after novel, enchanting his audience with his words.</p>
                    <p>Despite occurring many years apart from each other, both the Salem witch hunts and the witch hunts in Europe during the 15th and 16th century occurred under some similar instances. Most of the victims were women and many of the victims were elderly. In addition to both of these things is the presence of religious disputes (which was arguably the largest factor at play for both instances). In Europe during the 15th and 16th century, the Protestant Reformation was in full force in Europe and specifically Germany. Many people were leaving Roman Catholicism for new ideas on Christianity. This religious schism was of course met with opposition that took its form as the witch hunts. It’s estimated that over 100,000 people were accused of witchcraft and over 50,000 people were executed in the Holy Roman Empire during this time, yielding at least a 50% execution rate (Horn). Accusations of witchcraft were also much less common in areas that were not religiously divided. If we take a look at Salem in the 17th century, we can see examples of the predominantly Puritan society rejecting those of different religions, specifically Quakers (New England Historical Society). This created another religious schism and eventually accusations of witchcraft.</p>
                    <p>The members of the predominant religions did not like the emergence and growth of the new beliefs. It is likely that many people were afraid that their beliefs would lose popularity, meaning that practitioners of these beliefs would lose the control over society their religion provided them. Noel Hunter wrote an article about witch hunts where she says: “Often, control may be perceived when blame is cast and scapegoats are named” (Hunter). This is a very good explanation for the actions people took during each of the witch trials. The group of people who felt threatened began to cast blame on the marginalized groups: the smaller religious groups, women, elderly, etc.</p>
                    <p>This course of action is not specific to the witch trials. Instead it seems to be somehow rooted in humans, being inherent in a way. There are many instances of “blaming” groups for being different and casting them out of society. For example, Hitler required Jews in concentration camps as well as in Nazi occupied Europe to wear identifiable Stars of David on their person, singling them out from the rest of society because of their different beliefs (USHMM). There has even been some talk (maybe rumors, maybe misunderstood information) of Donald Trump creating a similar form of registry for Muslims and other refugees in America (Politifact). </p>
                    <p>In post 9/11 America, there are unfortunately many islamophobic people living in this country that would like to rid America of these people because of their different religion. This way of thinking is definitely reminiscent of the witch hunts and that’s extremely concerning. There has not been an instance in history where thinking this way and acting on it has yielded positive results. It always shows the worst of what humanity has to offer. It’s in cases like these where studying and learning from history is key; we must be able to recognize this unacceptable behavior and change our course of action before we take things too far.</p>
                    <p>Kurt Vonnegut’s novel Breakfast of Champions is a prime example of using the postmodern characteristic of using metafiction in writing. Vonnegut writes himself into his novel as a character and interacts with the creations of his own mind, some of which have existed in his other novels. One such character, Kilgore Trout, is a writer of many unknown science fiction novels and short stories, immediately showing some slight parallels between himself and Vonnegut. In the preface to the novel, Vonnegut writes that Breakfast of Champions is his way of clearing his “head of all the junk in there” (5). Vonnegut uses Trout as a means of putting his lost thoughts and ideas onto paper.</p>
					<p>Trout consistently recalls previous stories he has written which are often allegorical in nature (a chimpanzee who became president of the United States(88) and a planet where too many new species were being created and overpopulating the land(86)). These stories are allegorical in nature, discussing Vonnegut’s viewpoints on politics and social issues—the “junk” in his head. By this it could be considered that these stories were not just Trout’s fictional novels but also Vonnegut’s real life tossed ideas for stories. Some of them are quite absurd, and yet Vonnegut still wanted a way to write them down so he created Trout.</p>
					<p>The character came to represent not only Vonnegut’s lost ideas, but also his insecurities and doubts. In the novel’s epilogue, we see Vonnegut say farewell to Trout before Vonnegut travels back from the book world to the real world. During this exchange, Vonnegut tell’s Trout, “you are free,” (294) in order for Trout to “feel a wholeness and inner harmony such as I [Vonnegut]  have never allowed you to feel before” (293). In one way, Vonnegut is saying goodbye to his character because the novel ends in a few pages, and in another Vonnegut has finally cleared out all of his “junk” and is free himself. He is free of all of his forgotten story ideas and free of both his and Trout’s persisting pessimism which “overwhelmed him later in life” (31). Kilgore Trout’s final request to his creator is also his final words: “Make me young”(295). This is Vonnegut’s way of giving himself and Trout to live out the rest of their lives at peace with themselves and their existence. This final catharsis was the end of Vonnegut’s writing journey “to be born again”(218).</p>
                    <p>The 1960’s was home to a massive leap in the film industry. Directors were getting more ambitious with their projects and less conservative with their stories. Among these directors was a man named Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick would eventually come to create his movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, which many consider to be his magnum opus, and for some the magnum opus of the decade. The movie managed to not only present a realistic portrayal of earth’s future expeditions into the stars but also redefine an entire genre of film. Kubrick’s epic has become the most influential film of the 20th century and has continued to shape what we think of as movies to the present.</p>
                    <p>2001 takes place in the first year of an imagined 21st century. Humans have occupied satellites orbiting the earth, created advanced artificial intelligence systems, and are now journeying towards the Jovian System and beyond. Kubrick created a world that doesn’t seem too far into the future. The styling of the clothes and space suits are reminiscent of the clothing styles in the 1960’s; Pan Am has ventured into the space shuttling industry (and taken their trendy flight attendants with them); a tray of food similar to the TV dinners of the time is eaten by the astronauts. </p>
                    <p>In this world of familiarities, Kubrick has created a welcoming atmosphere for his viewers. This science fiction film is nothing like traditional sci-fi (Star Trek, Buck Rogers, Lost in Space)— Kubrick bridged the gap which divides the worlds of fantasy and real life. All audience members, regardless of their interest in science fiction, can now appreciate this movie and be interested by it. This is masterful work and can easily be overlooked. Even today, movies are not made for everyone to enjoy them. Looking at the current box office, many of the highest grossing films are superhero movies or just generic action films; it’s hard for everyone and his mother to appreciate these flicks. Movies are a subjective art form and each film cannot be universally appreciated, but when a movie comes close, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, that’s masterful work.</p>
                    <p>Within this realm of familiarity however still exists the futuristic aspects of the film. In order to capture certain nuances of the future, Kubrick was forced to develop new technology to create certain visual effects in the movie. From seemingly simple effects like a pen spinning away in zero gravity, to a psychedelic time warp sequence, effects that were never attempted before had to be made. The solutions ranged from very simple to very difficult and expensive. To create the floating pen, the solution was as simple as gluing a pen to a sheet of glass which was then manipulated in front of the camera to achieve the floating effect. Yet in contrast, $750,000 was spent to create a rotating centrifuge set that would create the illusion of artificial gravity on film. Even further was the creation of a variation on slit scan photography to shoot a psychedelic trip through the stars. This process had never been attempted and ended up being an extremely painstaking procedure that took months to finish the whole sequence. Yet another among the many new effects was the creation of realistic sets of Africa by using a set up of highly reflective screens and projectors. This ended up creating sets that upon first glance seem to be filmed on location rather than in a set.</p>
                    <p>The creation of these groundbreaking effects did not simply see their end once 2001 finished production. Instead, the effects have been used consistently since then. The star tip effect was used in the opening theme for BBC's Doctor Who in the 1970's and later in Star Trek: The Next Generation. More recently, Christopher Nolan decided on using rotating centrifuges for his 2010 film Inception to once again simulate disruptions in gravity rather than simply resorting to using computers to edit his effects. In a way, not only did the specific effects influence later films, but also the method of using practical rather than digital effects. It is very easy with today’s technology to create an illusion using computers so for directors to continue using traditional methods is proof of Kubrick’s lasting impact on the movie industry. Filming a movie “the hard way” incites a deeper appreciation for the film. There’s something authentic and more genuine about a movie that contains practical effects, as it reveals the director’s dedication to his work and his craft.</p>
                    <p>The way Kubrick created his masterpiece was more than just simply creating a narrative for a popcorn-munching audience to enjoy the plot of; in actuality, the film contains only 40 minutes of actual dialogue in its 140 minute run time. Straying from the path previously trodden by Hollywood directors, Kubrick’s diversion liberated him from the precedent. He successfully took 2001 in a direction more aligned with traditional poetry than narrative film. The movie is divided into four parts, which we can think of as the four stanzas to a poem. Certain aspects recur in each of the four parts— consumption of food, bodily care, and basic conflict. The parallelism in Kubrick’s piece is used alongside overarching themes that typically elude the audience. The movie must be analyzed for its true meanings to be revealed— the cyclical nature of humanity and mankind’s transformation due to technological advances. In this sense, as many poems do not reveal their theme upon an initial reading, Kubrick furthermore poeticizes his piece and transcends the traditional definition of a film.</p>
                    <p>While Kubrick undoubtedly created the most influential film of the 20th century, he also created one of the most inspirational movies. Few people argue against 2001: A Space Odyssey being the best science fiction film; George Lucas himself said that he used 2001 as an inspiration for Star Wars but that “2001 is far superior”. Lasting nearly fifty years, the movie has lost none of its original effectiveness and will continue to inspire and influence new movies being made.</p>
                    <p>Engineering, and more specifically, computers have always interested me even though I may not have known it at the time. Computers have always been a large part of my life. When I was five or six years old, my father and I took apart an old computer we did not use anymore. He taught me the names of the different parts and what each did. I specifically remember bringing an old CPU from this computer into first grade for Show and Tell. From simply dismantling the machines, I began to fix and modify other computers. I added more RAM, installed a new optical drive, and added sound cards, until eventually constructing my own desktop. I have always paid attention to the news for new technology announcements because I am eager to learn about new advancements in the field. Throughout high school, I’ve learned that my interest in computers has changed into a thirst to truly understand computers, rather than just know about them. Computer Engineering programs at the University of Michigan would provide the opportunity for me to build off my current base of knowledge and explore new directions in the field. </p>
                    <p>Perhaps one of the most attractive things about the University of Michigan is the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. The idea to do actual collegiate research as early as freshman year is amazing. I would absolutely love to do research on a topic I’m legitimately interested in and apply the knowledge I obtain through classes. The new things I would learn through UROP would definitely benefit me and prepare me for my future as an engineer.</p>
                    <p>I have viewed the course guide for majors in the College of Engineering and seeing the variety of classes fills me with an urge to learn. It’s almost overwhelming to see the classes I could take and the things I could learn, but overwhelming in a good way. So many of these classes sound interesting and exciting. </p>
                    <p>From a young age, children often dream of becoming rock stars or professional athletes. While these dreams are often forgotten for many, my dream of becoming an astronaut or working with outer space began in childhood and has continued throughout my life. The dream has motivated my interest in math and science, and from those, engineering. Becoming an engineer and working for a company like NASA or SpaceX has become a very real possibility. Everything from my past has led up to the realization that my goal throughout life has suddenly become obtainable, and that thought is both exciting and terrifying. </p>
					<p>I can feel it all way too much. There’s just too much, too much, too much. I’m going to attempt to put at least some of these many things out here so they’re no longer fucking my brain. Inexperienced with journaling, I have no idea where to begin. There’s just too much.</p>
                    <p>I close my eyes and see gray and black swirling. It’s similar to the album art for The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories) except there’s no face. It’s just anime-fight swirls of gray over a black space I think of as chaos. Chaos, what a cliche title. I suppose this cliched chaos should fit other preexisting molds its been assigned to for god knows how long by humans - infinite, vast, ever spreading, neverending, all consuming. Yet in my head it slowly becomes desaturated at the edges and fades. It’s confined to a softly vignetted space right in the center of my mind’s eye, directly behind my real eyes. This is what I see when I shut my eyes.</p>
                    <p>Another cliche I feel is the absolute weight of time. Sometimes every second hits me like a rock beaned directly at my skull. This is debilitating. I know everyone feels this to some extent. Someone I met said he once had a mental breakdown. He was able to “feel the sands of time slipping through his fingers” and I understand. </p>
                    <p>I can’t accept that it’s over. I can’t fucking accept that she’s gone.</p>
                    <p>I don’t think it’s fully hit me yet. I’ve cried I’ve sobbed yet part of me is still calm. I’m not sure. I’m scared. I can’t imagine what’s going to happen to me. I joined a discord server so maybe i can make some friends there. Also I should figure out what film clubs exist at michigan and maybe look into that. I need to buck up and do shit. Stop caring so much about your grades you probably dont even like your major that much anyway seriously focus oh god i miss her so much</p>
                    <p>I took a couple of creative liberties when designing and executing my ritual. My main goal was to research and choose an already existing ritual but alter it in some way. My reasoning for this was that by taking this class, I have come to believe that magic is a very personal thing. Many magical rituals are done for the self, either by directly bringing about self healing, casting a curse on someone you have a personal vendetta against, or to attract someone else to you with a binding spell. For my ritual, it felt right to modify this chosen ritual in some way and put my own spin on the process.</p>
                    <p>The ritual that I chose as my base is called the “Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram” (from here on referred to as the LBRP). This ritual is considered very basic and is actually the only ritual that one is required to know in order to join the Inner Order of the Order of the Golden Dawn (Kraig). The ritual is not very complex and has minimal requirements so it is perfect for beginners. The main purposes of the ritual are to function as a form of meditation allowing the magician to calm their mind (Maroney) and to banish chaos and impurities that exist around the magician (Exemplore). The ritual is easy to perform and the outcome is somewhat vague. This makes it the perfect ritual for me as it is open to manipulation.</p>
                    <p>I gained most of my inspiration from the paper we read in discussion, “Body Ritual Among the Nacierma” by Horace Miner. I liked the way Miner satirized typical American hygiene by making mundane, everyday routines seem like they were extremely bizarre and outlandish. This concept was very appealing to me so I decided to try something similar. I decided my ritual would also be based on an everyday routine people do but that routine would be executed via magic. I modified the LBRP to replace the need for someone to brush their teeth. The ritual is meant to provide protection against cavities, plaque, disease, etc. </p>
                    <p>Although there are slight differences in the procedure for the LBRP, they all follow a standard set of steps and requirements. In the most general case, an altar, candles, robe, and either a wand or steel dagger are all the required physical objects. After putting on the robe and lighting the candles on the altar, the wand is pointed at different parts of the body corresponding to points on the Qabalistic Cross. At each of these points, a phrase is said in Hebrew corresponding to different parts of the Lord’s Prayer (Thorn’s Meadow). After this, the wand is pointed in four directions around the magician: forwards, backwards, to the right, and to the left. In each of these directions, the magician proclaims the presence of an Archangel, standing there for protection. It is declared that the present magic is there to protect against and banish disorder, and then the Qabalistic Cross is repeated. The ritual is now finished (Mazohir).</p>
                    <p>There were many alterations I had to make for my ritual. I did not own a robe so I simply decided not to use one. Instead of an alter, I made a five-pointed star on the floor out of tape and placed a lit candle on each point. In the center of the star, I placed a dental mold of a human mouth to symbolically represent my own teeth. I performed the Qabalistic Cross the same but used a toothbrush instead of a wand or dagger. Rather than announcing the names of Archangels, I announced the names of oral hygiene brands (Colgate, Oral B, Aquafresh, and Listerine). I declared that the ritual was intended to protect my teeth from damage and decay, and then I finished the ritual by repeating the Qabalistic Cross. </p>
                    <p>As you can see, there are similarities and differences between the original LBRP and my own version. They both have the same structure, but the physical objects used and words said are different. Ultimately I deemed my changes appropriate given that magic and execution of rituals are very personal. Additionally, we discussed many times in class how magic usually results in intangible results and therefore the physical elements in the ritual are only there for symbolism. Many believe that a truly skilled magician doesn’t even need physical objects and can perform entire rituals entirely in their mind (Arcane Spells). For these reasons I felt that my ritual would still be effective as long as I believed the objects and phrases were working. </p>
                    <p>This way of thinking is very reminiscent of superstitious acts some people may do like not stepping on sidewalk cracks, wearing a lucky piece of clothing, or the way a baseball pitcher might rub the ball a certain way before throwing it. Each of these acts ultimately have no direct effect on the outcome of the situation. Instead, belief in a superstition can bring solace to a person, which will then bring about the desired outcome. For example, wearing a lucky shirt cannot possibly have a direct influence on how someone will perform on an exam, but that person’s belief in the lucky shirt can help calm them down which could then result in a better grade. I believe magic and the things we’ve studied in class work this way. Performing the LBRP will have no direct effect on the presence of disorder in your life, but the act of performing it may change your outlook on things and you may notice less negative things. Similarly, there is no physical way performing my teeth protection ritual will actually prevent me from getting cavities; the only way to do that is to properly brush and floss. It can be dangerous for someone to have so much faith in magic that they stop brushing their teeth altogether, for example. Scientific knowledge has increased exponentially since the time of Greco-Roman magic. It is important to acknowledge the limits of magic in the 21st century and the significance of scientific achievement.</p>
					<p>We discussed the premiere of Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” and Matisse’s “Blue Nude” in class. The two pieces of different forms of art caused great chaos and riots among people. I truly can’t comprehend something like this happening in present times. I’ve heard the “Rite of Spring” story from my orchestra conductor before, and even then it blew my mind. Art of that kind must have been appreciated more back then than it is today. Classical music is only of interest to a niche portion of the population, as is fine art. Of course, classical music was also the popular music of that time, but even still I can’t recall riots emerging over a specific instance of an unveiling of a new album.</p>
					<p>People freak out over cultural phenomenons like The Beatles or boy bands, but those are spread out over time. Trying to imagine a modern day equivalent to the “Rite of Spring” premiere greatly intrigues me. Reading more about the riots reveal that people do not even know what exactly started it. Some claim it was the music itself, having extreme dissonances and pounding rhythms. </p>
					<p>I think it would be a very newsworthy event if something of this degree were to happen today. Yet at the same time I believe it’s impossible for it to happen. Something about today’s culture and the obsession with the big (loud music, action movies, big explosions) makes me think that nothing can exceed our expectations by so much that we can’t comprehend what’s happening in front of us. I suppose this could be considered both a good or a bad thing, but I personally think it’s bad. We’ve become too numb to new ideas or enlightening events.</p>
                    <p>Everything seems to be moving faster and faster with each passing day, and a lot of the time it feels impossible to keep up. Thankfully, a large number of us have smartphones to help us keep track of it all. Note-taking apps are excellent in helping us ford the raging flow of information, and now more than ever have photographs become a fundamental way to “take notes.” When photographs were more of a precious commodity (having to pay a price for each individual picture taken), it was unheard of to waste a shot just to take note of something for later. The age of smartphones and cloud storage has opened the doors for basically unlimited photo storage capabilities. Following suit, taking pictures has become a new way to jot down and save information for later. Why force the date of an event into your memory when you could take a picture of the flyer? Why not take a picture of the whiteboard in lecture, of your insurance card information, of every moment of a concert? A similar question could be, why remember anything when the answers are just a Google search away? This is an attitude seemingly shared by many Americans, around forty percent, as found in a 2015 study by a psychology research group led by Nathaniel Barr from the University of Waterloo. With the internet as a resource, people have begun to use it as a supplementary memory tool to provide aid in remembering things for them.</p>
                    <p>Smartphones are undoubtedly an incredible tool for the modern American, but has the tool become too much of a crutch? Taking a picture to aid memory is incredibly simple and quick to do. It’s also much easier to record how something looks with a picture than committing it to memory or trying to draw or sketch it on paper. However, a study from 2013 conducted by Linda A. Henkel of Fairfield University discovered that the convenience of quickly snapping a picture directly correlated with worse memory retention. Participants were asked to travel around a museum and observe certain exhibits. One group was told to take photographs to record information about the exhibits while another group was asked to simply observe. Participants were later asked to recall information about the exhibits via a quiz. The results indicated that participants that took photographs received much lower scores on average. Interestingly enough, another group was asked to actively become more intimate with the exhibits before taking pictures. Participants were encouraged to zoom in on details and get up close and personal with pieces. In the results, this third group was effectively identical to the group that didn’t take pictures at all.</p>   
                    <p>If increasing intimacy when taking a photo increases memory retention, quickly taking a picture without any intimacy whatsoever for the purpose of note taking is quite ironic. This new note taking convention can spark other bad habits as well. With the popularity of picture based social media sites like Instagram, people are now able to share their personal photo album with the public online. With the ability to “like” and “favorite” images, an inherent competition is born. How many followers can I get? How many favorites can my picture get? People begin to become incredibly selective with what pictures they take and which ones they post in order to maximize their numbers and the overall aesthetic of their page. We’ve already established that the bad habit of just quickly snapping a picture of whatever is distant and superficial. Combining that habit with the motivation to better your online branding saps whatever life was left out of the photograph. </p>
                    <p>Photography can be a very beautiful way to capture the raw emotion and humanity and life of a very specific, short moment in time. If you’re only taking pictures with the intent to share them online, you’re only hurting yourself. Special events and important moments become minimized once the intent to turn that moment into an Instagram post is born. Minimized events will be focused on less while they’re happening, decreasing the intimacy of the moment and therefore decreasing the lasting memories of the moment. In a way, Instagram is a sort of note taking of your life, a photographic list of things you’ve done and places you’ve been to. It’s incredibly sad to think that you could be missing out on very important memories just because you wanted more likes.

                    <p>W.B. Yeats’s poem, “Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,” defies the set expectations for traditional love poems. Yeats uses the first person, specific diction, punctuation, and a shift as seen specifically in the lines “Enwrought with golden and silver light,” (line 2) “I would spread the cloths under your feet,” (line 5) and “Tread softly because you tread on my dreams” (line 8).</p>
                    <p>Yeats begins his poem with a few almost excessively romantic lines. The poem’s second line describes the beauty contained in heaven’s cloths. The fabric is “Enwrought with golden and silver light,” (line 2)  which are very ethereal colors, being representative of wealth and power. Riches of this level are nearly impossible for the narrator to have, yet he will try to give them anyway. Likewise, the “golden and silver light” is intangible, like heaven, but it is woven into a fabric in order for the narrator to give it as a gift of his love. This grand gesture of romance is an attempt to gift the impossible and ridiculous in nature. By writing about this absurdity of giving intangible things, Yeats subtly pokes fun at the methods of other romantic poets. He recognizes the futility in making such appealing promises that will eventually not be fulfilled due to their impossible nature and overdoes it in his poem to make his point.</p>
                    <p>In the fifth line of the poem, Yeats introduces a second character by using the word “your,” and the narrator now has a subject he can direct his previous loving statements towards. The first four lines of the poem contained images and details that are very romantic in nature. Combining these details with the new second character, Yeats makes his poem into a very traditional love poem. However, this is not the case. The fifth line of the poem is also a subjunctive statement— the narrator says that he “would spread the cloths” (line 5). Using the subjunctive mood shows the narrators incentive to perform this romantic act, yet it also implies his failure to do so. It raises the question that if he would do it, why didn’t he do it already? Because of this statement, the reader begins to recognize the shift that occurs in the following line. This shift transforms the poem from a very romantic poem into a modernist poem.</p>
                    <p>The line also ends with a colon rather than a comma or semicolon like other lines. If the line were to have ended with a period, the poem would function properly as a whole with no missing parts. However, the colon places the idea of some sort of afterthought to the poem, as if there is more to what the narrator is thinking. The colon provides impetus for the shift to occur, introducing the second half of the poem.</p>
                    <p>The love poem that Yeats had been writing up until this line is replaced by a poem that plays with the idea of love poems in general. In the previous four lines, the narrator is obviously trying to show his affection for another person, making declarations of his love through his desire to give gifts. The poem is about the narrator showing his love and the narrator is in control over the situation. However, the narrator’s failure to fulfill his desires set by the subjunctive shows his weakness and lack of control over the situation. He can promise his love anything he wants, yet none of that matters if he cannot actualize these promises. Because of this, the promises mean nothing and do not actually show his love. Yeats contradicts the format of a traditional love poem by transferring the control of the situation from the narrator to the person he loves.</p>
                    <p>The last three lines make up the second half, the more modernist half, of the poem. The narrator no longer has control over the situation and must trust his love with handling it. By the last line in the poem, the narrator has recognized that the cloths of heaven were no more than a dream, and so his gift is no more than a dream. He advises his love to “tread softly” in response to this gift. This basic request contains some defensive undertones by the use of the word “tread.” The word “tread” means to walk in a specific way or to trample or crush. By using this word, Yeats shows that the lover, the person being addressed in the poem, has the ability to either leave his dreams unharmed or crush them. This is significant because it further solidifies the importance of the shift in the sixth line as it shows the change in power from the narrator to his lover. In using “tread” instead of “walk” or any other variation, Yeats diverges from the traditional archetype of love poems by including the possibility of damage or harm, generally unwanted things in love.</p>
                    <p>By placing his dreams under his lover’s feet to be walked upon, the narrator attempts at a romantic gesture but falls far short. Typically, placing something under one’s feet is a romantic gesture done to keep the person’s feet clean or dry. While a cloth would achieve this purpose, dreams do not. Dreams are intangible objects and essentially nothing so therefore, this is a useless act by the narrator. Yeats once again uses this empty act of romance to diverge from more traditional poems.</p>
                    <p>Yeats’s poem features a transition from overly romantic ideas to very modernist interpretations of love. The first person point of view allows for a narrator to speak at someone else and create the setup for a typical love poem. Specific diction, such as with “gold and silver light” (line 2) allows for Yeats to address the absurdities of giving intangible gifts. Certain punctuation use in line 5 allows for a flow into the poem’s shift which changes the poem from romantic to modernist. In using a subjunctive statement (line 5), Yeats implies how a typical love poem should end and then diverges from that. All of the literary devices Yeats uses contribute to the transition between romantic and modernist style poetry and serve as a reflection on the flaws of romantic period thinking. </p>
					<p>Neutral Milk Hotel’s second, and as of now, last studio album “In the Aeroplane over the Sea” has slowly grown to be my favorite album. Although it was published in 1998, I discovered it a few years ago and the popularity of the album has since grown. It went from being an obscure folk rock album to a slightly less obscure folk rock album. The music from this album as well as the rest of the group’s songs really struck me when I first heard it. There’s really no other music like it at all, combining folk style guitar, seemingly nonsensical lyrics, and an eclectic collection of other instruments including accordion, horns, bowed banjo, and singing saw. On top of this, the album was recorded in a way that mimics the distorted and sometimes muddy sound found on homemade cassette tapes which was how the band originally started. </p>
                    <p>I used an old tape deck in my house to record the album onto a cassette tape for my car since my car predates having a CD player in it. I had the tape in my car since I first started driving but it wasn’t until the start of senior year that I really started using it. The tape was always playing in my car from the beginning of school until about mid-December. When the album ended, I rewound the tape and started it over again and again until I learned (nearly) all of the lyrics to the songs. The lyrics themselves don’t have tremendous significance to me, seeing as they’re mainly about the life of Anne Frank, but the circumstances of the songs will stick with my. I still flashback to the start of the school year and the whirl of events that were occurring in my life during that time whenever I hear a song off the album and I’m sure this will be the case well into the future.</p>
                    <p>During Lincoln’s presidency, he had many issues bearing down upon him. His main emphasis during his presidency was that the union should be preserved and that the South’s secession would be detrimental to the nation. Lincoln’s approach to the solution of these issues changed from one of peaceful negotiation to one of violence through civil war. If he were to survive through his second term, his main theme of his farewell address would be one of reconstruction and repairing the bond between the nation that was broken.</p>
                    <p>Lincoln held a firm belief that a secession of states from the Union could only cause harm. Through his speeches, he justified his stance. Lincoln’s election is the final thing to anger the South. Since Lincoln was elected without any Southern electoral votes, the South was upset and took the opportunity to secede.He refers to the South’s secession, beginning with South Carolina in 1860, as “[a] disruption of the Federal Union...” (1st Inaugural Address). Lincoln’s portrayal of the South as usurpers provides a foundation for the cement of Lincoln’s emphasis to be set upon. Furthermore, in 1861, Lincoln gives a speech that gives even further support for his doctrine. In his speech, Lincoln spoke of the Confederate States as “[an] illegal organization and he used words such as “menaced” and “warlike” to describe their exploits (July 4 Speech). The negative tone associated with these words presents validation for Lincoln’s ideology. His frustration with the South continued to grow as the Civil War kept corrupting the country. Because of this pressing urgency, Lincoln decided to take action. Although Lincoln did not officially free the slaves until the 13th amendment to the Constitution passes, he takes prior action. In 1863, Lincoln symbolically declared the slaves of southern states free. Lincoln presented this through his speech, “The Emancipation Proclamation.” The speech also declares that the military’s involvement in the war is “...a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing [the rebellion]” (Emancipation Proclamation). The secession of the southern states has transformed into a rebellion against the Union under Lincoln’s eyes. In the aftermath of one of the worst battles of the war, Lincoln gives a speech in Gettysburg. When giving his famous Gettysburg Address, Lincoln makes winning the war and returning the Union to its former state the utmost priority. He goes even further to say “Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation... can long endure.” Lincoln states that if the North does not win, the Union and the government shall no longer exist. However, he is adamant that the North will be victorious, and that the Union “shall not perish from the earth” (Gettysburg Address). Now, with the Civil War coming to an end, Lincoln began his second term in office. In his Second Inaugural Address, he mentions what occurred four years ago, when the war was just beginning. He portrays the Confederacy in a negative light, saying how their agents were “seeking to destroy [the Union] without war” however, war started anyway as “[the South] would make war rather than let the nation survive, and [the North] would accept war rather than let it perish” (Second Inaugural Address). His graveness when speaking of the breaking up of the Union as letting it perish shows his severity on the point that the Union should be preserved at all costs. Lincoln’s continual stress on the importance of preserving the Union throughout the majority of his speeches demonstrates how important he felt it to be, and thus, he made it his major emphasis in his speeches.</p>
                    <p>Throughout Lincoln’s presidency, his tone towards issues that were bearing down on the country changed, particularly the Civil War. Beginning with his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln felt that in order to keep the Union together, war was not necessary or wanted. Lincoln thought that while trying to restore the Union, “..there needs to be no bloodshed or violence...” (First Inaugural Address). He believed that war was not the answer to the nation’s issues; it would only make things worse. The problems caused by fighting were already visible in “Bleeding Kansas,” and Lincoln did not want the entire country behaving like that. When he gave his speech on the fourth of July, Lincoln began to change his tone on the matter of war. He states that there was “no choice but to call out the war power of the government” (Fourth of July Speech). He reluctantly agrees now that war was necessary, but only when all other options were gone. When Lincoln gave his Emancipation Proclamation, stated that all the previous options had vanished, and that war against Jefferson Davis and the Confederate States was now necessary. Lincoln finally acknowledges that “[the people of the Confederate States] are this day in rebellion against the United States...”(Emancipation Proclamation).  The new war trudges on, until tragedy strikes in Gettysburg. When Lincoln makes his statement there, he mentions that the country must be devoted to the war so that “...this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom” (Gettysburg Address). He firmly believes that by winning the war, the Union will not perish. Finally, at the dawn of his second term, Lincoln reminisces on the war, now coming to an end. He makes this statement: “Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came” (Second Inaugural Address). Lincoln’s final stance on the war was in support of it. The change from being opposed to violence to supporting it was evident throughout each of his speeches. Gradually, he began to support war because the Union’s preservation was threatened more and more. Lincoln took the proper path of a president and changed his view in order to help his country survive.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, Lincoln did not survive through his second term, and did not get to see his plans for reconstruction through. However, if he had lived, his farewell address would mainly focus on reconstruction and forgiveness. When Robert E. Lee surrenders, a general asks lincoln how the confederates were to be punished, Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy.” During Lincoln’s second inaugural address, he states, “With malice toward none, with charity for all... let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds” (Second Inaugural Address). In his final public address, Lincoln says “We all agree that the seceded States... are out of their proper practical relation with the Union; and that the sole object of the government... is to again get them into that proper practical relation” (Last public address). Lincoln thought that restoring the southern states to their previous situation, not punishment, was of utmost importance. In his first inaugural address, Lincoln firmly states “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies” (First Inaugural Address). While southerners were in open hostility to the government, Lincoln still believes that only peace and forgiveness could end the conflict.  All of these examples show Lincoln’s emphasis on forgiving the South, and he would pass on this advice to his successor.  Lincoln also felt that preserving the Union came first, and would likely include the idea in his farewell address. On April 15, 1861, Lincoln calls on all the states to send troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and “preserve the union”. Lincoln’s belief in the union, even though the Southern states had seceded, is a testament to how firmly he thought that the Union must be preserved.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his presidency, Lincoln matured his political ideals. The events that shaped our country also helped redefine what Lincoln thought was the right thing to do. While his emphasis changed, the degree to which he found it important increased exponentially. He realized the serious threat the Confederate States posed to the Union and decided to take drastic measures in order to prevent the possible demise. The actions taken by Abraham Lincoln set examples for his successors to follow by. Lincoln is regarded as one of the best presidents the United States has had since its beginning for a reason, and that was not because of his top hat and beard.</p>
					<p>At the end of middle school, I lost nearly half of my friends to other high schools in the city. As a rising freshman, I decided to join my high school’s marching band as a way to explore my interest in music and ultimately make new friends. I was terrified of hearing the stories about interactions between the seniors in high school and the freshmen; the limited social exchanges between the two groups took place in the form of pelting freshmen with pennies on the infamous “Freshman Fridays.” I found that the marching band community had none of these social stigmas. There was a group of seniors that I shared interests in and began to just follow them around, hoping to leech friendship off of them. Surprisingly it worked, and they let me be their friend. These older kids genuinely liked and appreciated me, and to a freshman, it was amazing. These friends and I continue to maintain our friendships even though some of them are across the country and even across the world.</p>
                    <p>The close-knit nature of band emerges from the long hours spent in rehearsals and at competitions. Friendship is inevitable, but the band was also a second family. In high school where cliques are abundant, band acted as a kind of safe haven. There was no discrimination or popularity ranking and freshmen and seniors could be friends without question. It’s strange to look back to my freshman year and think that I am now the same age as the kids who befriended me three years ago. It makes me fully appreciate their act of kindness and motivates me to continue to maintain the accepting nature of the band community.</p>
                    <p>tell us about your devil idea</p>
                    <p>cultists</p>
                    <p>how about</p>
                    <p>basically</p>
                    <p>the cultists think something is a sign from some sort of being, the sun god dammit. mkay. and they think it’s supernatural shit. and at some point, these weird cultist type people explain like these events in some sort of supernatural way and uh there’s obviously a scientific explanation for this they will find. they give them this supernatural sort of answer they go along with up until. idk. i was talking about cultists originally. </p>
					<p>Our dig site in central Iraq, near where the ancient city of Seleucia once was, has yielded some very interesting finds over the past few weeks. Two such items look very common and simple upon first inspection; they are a pair of bowls. The bowls are both roughly six inches in diameter and three inches deep, made of clay, and most likely date back to somewhere between the 4th and 7th century AD. As bowls from this time and region, there is nothing necessarily unique about their size and material.</p>
					<p>However, these bowls stands out in other regards. The insides of the bowls are inscribed with text that spirals down towards the bottom. At the bottom of one of the bowls is a strange symbol. I have been examining the writing for the past few days and have come to the conclusion that it is not written in any known language. The script is entirely gibberish and the symbol at the bottom of one of the bowls, a square with circles at each of the corners isn’t one I’ve seen before. The bowls’ construction is fairly crude and are most likely handmade rather than mass produced. The bowls are fully intact but have minor cracks and nicks throughout, as is expected from clay items that have been buried for centuries.</p>
					<p>After further researching the bowls, I have discovered that they are examples of “incantation bowls,” or “demon bowls,” which were a type of protective magic found solely in the Middle East. People would create these bowls in order to capture and protect against demons — evil spirits that would bring illness or misfortune — that plagued the home. The bowls were often placed near doors or the corners of the home, where it was believed demons could enter through the cracks in the home. A single bowl could be used or two bowls could be used, with one bowl placed on top of the other, essentially creating a cage for the trapped demon. The two bowls we excavated were found next to each other in the corner of a foundation for a house, which is consistent previously found bowls.</p>
					<p>The spiraling pattern of the text is definitely worth noting. It bears a similar resemblance to an ancient way of writing magical healing spells known as “vanishing text.” These spells were written so that each line was written with fewer characters than the last, and so on, until there was only a single character left; just as the text would disappear, hopefully so would the sickness. I believe the spiral pattern was used in a similar way with magical intent: to guide the demon further and further into the bottom of the bowl so it could not escape. Furthermore, I believe the unknown symbol at the bottom of one of the bowls resembles a room with an incantation bowl at each of the corners. This could possibly mean there were bowls placed in each corner of this home, however our excavation has not found any more as of now.</p>
					<p>Whoever lived in the home must have had a great deal of misfortune to have potentially placed many incantation bowls in their home; perhaps their children kept dying shortly after birth or their crops were not growing. Whatever the specific cause of their misfortune was, they most likely resorted to magical help because they were not very wealthy. A family of higher class would have better access to medicine or whatever sort of remedy their situation demanded. In contrast, it was very easy and inexpensive to mold your own bowl out of clay. The gibberish writing is another indication of the household’s wealth. A wealthier family would either know how to write or could at least pay someone to inscribe the bowl for them. The nonsense writing is indicative of someone without the ability to write trying to cast the spell. It was most likely believed that the nature of the writing — the spiraling pattern— was more important than the actual words of the spell.</p>
                    <p>The idea of “historicity” was mentioned in class this week. It was an idea I had never really thought about before. History books usually focus on two things: a selective handful of individuals who made a large impact, and the entire collective of everyone else. Maybe, and probably, studying the life of some average civilian isn’t as exciting or even interesting as the life of a political or economic visionary, yet it’s also unfair. That person lived their own unique life, had their own impact on the world, no matter how small, yet their story won’t get carried into the future like a powerful political figure living at the same time will. </p>
                    <p>I guess this is what makes personal family photographs so interesting to me. My mom has always bought old photographs or paper documents at garage and estate sales she goes to. I used to think she was nuts for doing this, but it only takes one time of clicking through a family’s vacation slides to understand why she enjoys seeking such things out. For all we know, these photos are the last remaining piece of this family’s story. The pictures could have just been tossed into the trash if my mom had not picked them up for pennies. If they had been thrown away, the pictures would’ve been lost, sure, but also this family’s entire story. </p>
                    <p>It’s an interesting thought to think that not that long ago, someone’s entire life story could be lost by a house fire or an ignorant relative throwing things away. But in today’s time things are a little different. I made an email account when I was fairly young, about 13 years ago, and for whatever reason never really deleted any emails. You can go back in my inbox and see a record of me growing up and interacting with new friends, etc. Furthermore, online forums keep records of people and interactions between people that can’t be lost through physical means like fire or water damage. These interactions will be preserved electronically for who knows how long and I think that this current generation will be the first to have a real documentation of our historicity that future generations can look back and read.</p>
					<p>It's been a long time since anyone really paid attention to me, and that's for the best. It's what I want. I've learned that it only makes my day to day life simpler if I can just blend into the forever-endless crowd of strangers you encounter every day. The people that you definitely realize you walk by, but are never unable to recall what they looked like or even which direction they were headed. It's not your fault that your brain can't afford the extra neurons to store this useless info. The world couldn't possibly function if every human was capable of regurgitating an exact description of every second of every minute of every day. And thank God. I capitalize on this truth in order to blend in. I don't know what the fuck I'd do if people actually realized that I exist</p>
					<p>It's been so long since anyone really paid attention to me, and it fucking sucks. It's not what I want. I've learned that it often makes my day to day life an impossible hell when no one recognizes that I exist as an individual. I'm not just some Tom, Dick, or Harry that you'll walk by on the street and forget. I have so much to offer to the world. I goddamn deserve to be recognized, celebrated, and remembered. Fuck how self centered humanity has become with their obsession on the instant access to euphoria provided by technology and smart phones. I could offer you 100 times more than your shitty iPhone ever could goddammit. Fuck God. This truth of the world stunts my abilities and my worth. I don't know how the world can't see this and I don't know what I'm going to do about it.</p>
