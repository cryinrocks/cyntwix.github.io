                    <p>Inspired by my uncle, I wanted to try analog photography the summer after my high school graduation. I'd played around with some photography before, and I was heavily interested in studying the cinemetography and DP's of my favorite movies, but for some reason  I never felt like I could commit to the hobby.</p>
                    <p>My stupid facebook feed was filled with tons of garbage "[insert name here] Photography!" pages created by classmates who got a DSLR for their birthday and wanted to take shallow depth of field pictures of their friends since their phones couldn't get that oh so artsy bokeh</p>
					<p>This sorta skewed my feelings about photography. Everyone seemed like a hack to me, so if I started myself, I'd probably feel like a hack too. Too many delusional people thinking that by downloading lightroom and learning how to adjust exposure curves that they could have a photography career. Some people I know are still chasing this fantasy and haven't improved in the slightest.</p>
					
					<p>So I thought, if I was gonna start taking pictures, there needed to be something MORE to it all. My dumb friends would make fun of me by saying that I'm a "hipster" or "indie" for thinking this way, but my thoughts weren't (necessarily) guided by the desire to be different and use old tech that wasn't seen in the modern zeitgeist. Instead, I was guided by this preexisting and foreverexisting desire for tangibility in my work, whatever that work may be. I vastly prefer physical books to ebooks; I vastly prefer to take notes on paper rather than a word doc; I vastly prefer to make lists on loose paper to plan for a project rather than do it digitally. Analog photography feels more like making a photo than taking a photo to me, and it's that making that really creates the feeling of permanance for me.</p>
					
					<p>I was also guided by the interests of my mother and my uncle. My mom was (is) very much passionate about rescuing and digitzing media that may be lost forever if she didn't step in. She'll scoop up family photo albums and boxes of negatives at estate sales lest they be tossed in the garbage and rot away in some landfill. It brings her, and myself, great sadness to think of all the lost faces and memories that were just tossed away. While some people may tell you otherwise, you'll never truly find someone who would be angry for seeing old pictures of their friends, family, and life that they forgot existed. It's important to keep these things alive. It's a human thing to do.</p>
					
                    <p>My uncle used to have photography as a hobby of his. In addition to the etchings he would often make, the walss of our home were adorned with his photographs. Visiting his home, you'd see cameras and photographs and equipment all scattered around every room. He'd travel across the country, camping along the way in Ford Pinto he'd modified to extend its trunk into a tent, and just takes pictures of things. He was really really good at it and this always inspired me to always be exploring and flex my creative muscles.</p>
                    <p>Writing this some four or five years after I first picked up my dad's old Nikon FG, I can't remember the exact impetus that kicked this whole thing off. Obviously some sum of the above inspirations but there must've been something in addition. I could sit and theorize all day to make a guess at the exact reason but ultimately it wouldn't mean anything. That time of my life is incredibly blurry as my subconscious has likely tried to shut out all the specifics of things that made me feel shitty overall. So it goes, life goes on, yadda yadda yadda, who gives a fuck?</p>
                    <p>The only thing that matters is that I've stuck to the hobby and grown alongside it. I've adopted every aspect of the hobby now, from rolling my own film to developing and scanning it myself. I've cut the costs low but my confidence in my abilities as well as objective skill has only gone up. Although there have been some ups-and-downs and periods of time where I've completely dropped it, I'm proud that I can call this hobby mine.</p>
					<p>I've used flickr as the site to post my photos since day 1 since it was more user friendly than Instagram. Also, Instagram has that terrible knack social media sites all have to let everyone you know in real life be able to find your profile. I want to separate things I create from my public image likely due to a severe lack of self confidence. Also, why do Betsty and Brian need to see what I do when I haven't spoken to them since middle school? I'd rather share my stuff with people who don't know the face behind the work. It feels better this way. Flickr has allowed me this since 1) who uses flickr? and 2) it's not as "social media" driven as other sites. </p>
					<p>Unfortunately, I have moved over to Instagram. Death already has his scythe around flickr's neck and is just waiting to pull. Or maybe he'll cough, convulse, and end it prematurely. Dunno. Dunno. But Death has a tickle in his throat, for sure. Instagram has proved to be pretty nice so far actually. People have been very friendly and I think limiting the number of IRL people and people from my past to be aware of it really helps.</p>
